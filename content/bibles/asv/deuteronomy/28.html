<div><h4>Deuteronomy 28</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And it shall come to pass, if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of Jehovah thy God, to observe to do all his commandments which I command thee this day, that Jehovah thy God will set thee on high above all the nations of the earth:</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> and all these blessings shall come upon thee, and overtake thee, if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of Jehovah thy God.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Blessed shalt thou be in the city, and blessed shalt thou be in the field.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Blessed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy ground, and the fruit of thy beasts, the increase of thy cattle, and the young of thy flock.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Blessed shall be thy basket and thy kneading-trough.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Blessed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and blessed shalt thou be when thou goest out.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Jehovah will cause thine enemies that rise up against thee to be smitten before thee: they shall come out against thee one way, and shall flee before thee seven ways.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Jehovah will command the blessing upon thee in thy barns, and in all that thou puttest thy hand unto;

for the locust shall consume it.</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> Thou shalt plant vineyards and dress them, but thou shalt neither drink of the wine, nor gather [the grapes]; for the worm shall eat them.</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> Thou shalt have olive-trees throughout all thy borders, but thou shalt not anoint thyself with the oil; for thine olive shall cast [its fruit].</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> Thou shalt beget sons and daughters, but they shall not be thine; for they shall go into captivity.</span><span class="42"> <sup>42</sup> All thy trees and the fruit of thy ground shall the locust possess.</span><span class="43"> <sup>43</sup> The sojourner that is in the midst of thee shall mount up above thee higher and higher;

because thou hearkenedst not unto the voice of Jehovah thy God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which he commanded thee:</span><span class="46"> <sup>46</sup> and they shall be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder, and upon thy seed for ever.</span><span class="47"> <sup>47</sup> Because thou servedst not Jehovah thy God with joyfulness, and with gladness of heart, by reason of the abundance of all things;</span><span class="48"> <sup>48</sup> therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies that Jehovah shall send against thee, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in want of all things: and he shall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck, until he have destroyed thee.</span><span class="49"> <sup>49</sup> Jehovah will bring a nation against thee from far, from the end of the earth, as the eagle flieth; a nation whose tongue thou shalt not understand;</span><span class="50"> <sup>50</sup> a nation of fierce countenance, that shall not regard the person of the old, nor show favor to the young,</span><span class="51"> <sup>51</sup> and shall eat the fruit of thy cattle, and the fruit of thy ground, until thou be destroyed; that also shall not leave thee grain, new wine, or oil, the increase of thy cattle, or the young of thy flock, until they have caused thee to perish.</span><span class="52"> <sup>52</sup> And they shall besiege thee in all thy gates, until thy high and fortified walls come down, wherein thou trustedst, throughout all thy land; and they shall besiege thee in all thy gates throughout all thy land, which Jehovah thy God hath given thee.</span><span class="53"> <sup>53</sup> And thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body, the flesh of thy sons and of thy daughters, whom Jehovah thy God hath given thee, in the siege and in the distress wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee.</span><span class="54"> <sup>54</sup> The man that is tender among you, and very delicate, his eye shall be evil toward his brother, and toward the wife of his bosom, and toward the remnant of his children whom he hath remaining;</span><span class="55"> <sup>55</sup> so that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall eat, because he hath nothing left him, in the siege and in the distress wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in all thy gates.</span><span class="56"> <sup>56</sup> The tender and delicate woman among you, who would not adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness and tenderness, her eye shall be evil toward the husband of her bosom, and toward her son, and toward her daughter,</span><span class="57"> <sup>57</sup> and toward her young one that cometh out from between her feet, and toward her children whom she shall bear; for she shall eat them for want of all things secretly, in the siege and in the distress wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in thy gates.</span><span class="58"> <sup>58</sup> If thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book, that thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name, JEHOVAH THY GOD;</span><span class="59"> <sup>59</sup> then Jehovah will make thy plagues wonderful, and the plagues of thy seed, even great plagues, and of long continuance, and sore sicknesses, and of long continuance.</span><span class="60"> <sup>60</sup> And he will bring upon thee again all the diseases of Egypt, which thou wast afraid of; and they shall cleave unto thee.</span><span class="61"> <sup>61</sup> Also every sickness, and every plague, which is not written in the book of this law, them will Jehovah bring upon thee, until thou be destroyed.</span><span class="62"> <sup>62</sup> And ye shall be left few in number, whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude; because thou didst not hearken unto the voice of Jehovah thy God.</span><span class="63"> <sup>63</sup> And it shall come to pass, that, as Jehovah rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you, so Jehovah will rejoice over you to cause you to perish, and to destroy you; and ye shall be plucked from off the land whither thou goest in to possess it.</span><span class="64"> <sup>64</sup> And Jehovah will scatter thee among all peoples, from the one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth; and there thou shalt serve other gods, which thou hast not known, thou nor thy fathers, even wood and stone.</span><span class="65"> <sup>65</sup> And among these nations shalt thou find no ease, and there shall be no rest for the sole of thy foot: but Jehovah will give thee there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and pining of soul;</span><span class="66"> <sup>66</sup> and thy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou shalt fear night and day, and shalt have no assurance of thy life.</span><span class="67"> <sup>67</sup> In the morning thou shalt say, Would it were even! and at even thou shalt say, Would it were morning! for the fear of thy heart which thou shalt fear, and for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see.</span><span class="68"> <sup>68</sup> And Jehovah will bring thee into Egypt again with ships, by the way whereof I said unto thee, Thou shalt see it no more again: and there ye shall sell yourselves unto your enemies for bondmen and for bondwomen, and no man shall buy you.</span></div>
