So shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, that is as thine own soul, entice thee secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which thou hast not known, thou, nor thy fathers;</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> of the gods of the peoples that are round about you, nigh unto thee, or far off from thee, from the one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth;</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him; neither shall thine eye pity him, neither shalt thou spare, neither shalt thou conceal him:</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> but thou shalt surely kill him; thy hand shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And thou shalt stone him to death with stones, because he hath sought to draw thee away from Jehovah thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And all Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall do not more any such wickedness as this is in the midst of thee.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> If thou shalt hear tell concerning one of thy cities, which Jehovah thy God giveth thee to dwell there, saying,</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Certain base fellows are gone out from the midst of thee, and have drawn away the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which ye have not known;</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> then shalt thou inquire, and make search, and ask diligently; and, behold, if it be truth, and the thing certain, that such abomination is wrought in the midst of thee,</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, destroying it utterly, and all that is therein and the cattle thereof, with the edge of the sword.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of the street thereof, and shalt burn with fire the city, and all the spoil thereof every whit, unto Jehovah thy God: and it shall be a heap for ever; it shall not be built again.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And there shall cleave nought of the devoted thing to thy hand; that Jehovah may turn from the fierceness of his anger, and show thee mercy, and have compassion upon thee, and multiply thee, as he hath sworn unto thy fathers;</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> when thou shalt hearken to the voice of Jehovah thy God, to keep all his commandments which I command thee this day, to do that which is right in the eyes of Jehovah thy God.</span></div>
