<div><h4>Romans 14</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> But him that is weak in faith receive ye, [yet] not for decision of scruples.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> One man hath faith to eat all things: but he that is weak eateth herbs.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Let not him that eateth set at nought him that eateth not; and let not him that eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Who art thou that judgest the servant of another? to his own lord he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be made to stand; for the Lord hath power to make him stand.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day [alike]. Let each man be fully assured in his own mind.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord: and he that eateth, eateth unto the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, unto the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For none of us liveth to himself, and none dieth to himself.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; or whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For to this end Christ died and lived [again], that he might be Lord of both the dead and the living.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> But thou, why dost thou judge thy brother? or thou again, why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment-seat of God.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, to me every knee shall bow, And every tongue shall confess to God.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> So then each one of us shall give account of himself to God.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge ye this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock in his brother's way, or an occasion of falling.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> I know, and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean of itself: save that to him who accounteth anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> For if because of meat thy brother is grieved, thou walkest no longer in love. Destroy not with thy meat him for whom Christ died.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Let not then your good be evil spoken of:</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> For he that herein serveth Christ is well-pleasing to God, and approved of men.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> So then let us follow after things which make for peace, and things whereby we may edify one another.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Overthrow not for meat's sake the work of God. All things indeed are clean; howbeit it is evil for that man who eateth with offence.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> It is good not to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor [to do anything] whereby thy brother stumbleth.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> The faith which thou hast, have thou to thyself before God. Happy is he that judgeth not himself in that which he approveth.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> But he that doubteth is condemned if he eat, because [he eateth] not of faith; and whatsoever is not of faith is sin.</span></div>
