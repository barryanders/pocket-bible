<div><h4>Numbers 23</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on every altar a bullock and a ram.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And Balaam said unto Balak, Stand by thy burnt-offering, and I will go: peradventure Jehovah will come to meet me; and whatsoever he showeth me I will tell thee. And he went to a bare height.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And God met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared the seven altars, and I have offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And Jehovah put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said, Return unto Balak, and thus thou shalt speak.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And he returned unto him, and, lo, he was standing by his burnt-offering, he, and all the princes of Moab.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And he took up his parable, and said, From Aram hath Balak brought me, The king of Moab from the mountains of the East: Come, curse me Jacob, And come, defy Israel.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? And how shall I defy, whom Jehovah hath not defied?</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For from the top of the rocks I see him, And from the hills I behold him: lo, it is a people that dwelleth alone, And shall not be reckoned among the nations.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Who can count the dust of Jacob, Or number the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, And let my last end be like his!</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thou done unto me? I took thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast blessed them altogether.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which Jehovah putteth in my mouth?</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And Balak said unto him, Come, I pray thee, with me unto another place, from whence thou mayest see them; thou shalt see but the utmost part of them, and shalt not see them all: and curse me them from thence.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And he took him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy burnt-offering, while I meet [Jehovah] yonder.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And Jehovah met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, Return unto Balak, and thus shalt thou speak.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And he came to him, and, lo, he was standing by his burnt-offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto him, What hath Jehovah spoken?</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And he took up his parable, and said, Rise up, Balak, and hear; Hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor:</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> God is not a man, that he should lie, Neither the son of man, that he should repent: Hath he said, and will he not do it? Or hath he spoken, and will he not make it good?</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Behold, I have received [commandment] to bless: And he hath blessed, and I cannot reverse it.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob; Neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel: Jehovah his God is with him, And the shout of a king is among them.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> God bringeth them forth out of Egypt; He hath as it were the strength of the wild-ox.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Surely there is no enchantment with Jacob; Neither is there any divination with Israel: Now shalt it be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought!</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Behold, the people riseth up as a lioness, And as a lion doth he lift himself up: He shall not lie down until he eat of the prey, And drink the blood of the slain.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> And Balak said unto Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> But Balaam answered and said unto Balak, Told not I thee, saying, All that Jehovah speaketh, that I must do?</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> And Balak said unto Balaam, Come now, I will take thee unto another place; peradventure it will please God that thou mayest curse me them from thence.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> And Balak took Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh down upon the desert.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar.</span></div>
