<div><h4>Revelation 11</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And there was given me a reed like unto a rod: and one said, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship therein.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And the court which is without the temple leave without, and measure it not; for it hath been given unto the nations: and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And I will give unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in sackcloth.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> These are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks, standing before the Lord of the earth.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And if any man desireth to hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth and devoureth their enemies; and if any man shall desire to hurt them, in this manner must he be killed.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> These have the power to shut the heaven, that it rain not during the days of their prophecy: and they have power over the waters to turn them into blood, and to smite the earth with every plague, as often as they shall desire.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that cometh up out of the abyss shall make war with them, and overcome them, and kill them.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And their dead bodies [lie] in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And from among the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations do [men] look upon their dead bodies three days and a half, and suffer not their dead bodies to be laid in a tomb.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And they that dwell on the earth rejoice over them, and make merry; and they shall send gifts one to another; because these two prophets tormented them that dwell on the earth.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And after the three days and a half the breath of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them that beheld them.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come up hither. And they went up into heaven in the cloud; and their enemies beheld them.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And in that hour there was a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell; and there were killed in the earthquake seven thousand persons: and the rest were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> The second Woe is past: behold, the third Woe cometh quickly.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And the seventh angel sounded; and there followed great voices in heaven, and they said, The kingdom of the world is become [the kingdom] of our Lord, and of his Christ: and he shall reign for ever and ever.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And the four and twenty elders, who sit before God on their thrones, fell upon their faces and worshipped God,</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> saying, We give thee thanks, O Lord God, the Almighty, who art and who wast; because thou hast taken thy great power, and didst reign.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And the nations were wroth, and thy wrath came, and the time of the dead to be judged, and [the time] to give their reward to thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and to them that fear thy name, the small and the great; and to destroy them that destroy the earth.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> And there was opened the temple of God that is in heaven; and there was seen in his temple the ark of his covenant; and there followed lightnings, and voices, and thunders, and an earthquake, and great hail.</span></div>
