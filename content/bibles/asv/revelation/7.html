<div><h4>Revelation 7</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> After his I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that no wind should blow on the earth, or on the sea, or upon any tree.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And I saw another angel ascend from the sunrising, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a great voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea,</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we shall have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And I heard the number of them that were sealed, a hundred and forty and four thousand, sealed out of every tribe of the children of Israel:</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Of the tribe of Judah [were] sealed twelve thousand: Of the tribe of Reuben twelve thousand; Of the tribe of Gad twelve thousand;</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Of the tribe of Asher twelve thousand; Of the tribe of Naphtali twelve thousand; Of the tribe of Manasseh twelve thousand;</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Of the tribe of Simeon twelve thousand; Of the tribe of Levi twelve thousand; Of the tribe of Issachar twelve thousand;</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Of the tribe of Zebulun twelve thousand; Of the tribe of Joseph twelve thousand; Of the tribe of Benjamin [were] sealed twelve thousand.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> After these things I saw, and behold, a great multitude, which no man could number, out of every nation and of [all] tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, arrayed in white robes, and palms in their hands;</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> and they cry with a great voice, saying, Salvation unto our God who sitteth on the throne, and unto the Lamb.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And all the angels were standing round about the throne, and [about] the elders and the four living creatures; and they fell before the throne on their faces, and worshipped God,</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> saying, Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honor, and power, and might, [be] unto our God for ever and ever.
