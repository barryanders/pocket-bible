<div><h4>Revelation 15</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, seven angels having seven plagues, [which are] the last, for in them is finished the wrath of God.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire; and them that come off victorious from the beast, and from his image, and from the number of his name, standing by the sea of glass, having harps of God.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvellous are thy works, O Lord God, the Almighty; righteous and true are thy ways, thou King of the ages.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Who shall not fear, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for thou only art holy; for all the nations shall come and worship before thee; for thy righteous acts have been made manifest.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And after these things I saw, and the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened:</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> and there came out from the temple the seven angels that had the seven plagues, arrayed with [precious] stone, pure [and] bright, and girt about their breasts with golden girdles.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And one of the four living creatures gave unto the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and none was able to enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels should be finished.</span></div>
