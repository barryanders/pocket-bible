<div><h4>Revelation 14</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And I saw, and behold, the Lamb standing on the mount Zion, and with him a hundred and forty and four thousand, having his name, and the name of his Father, written on their foreheads.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and the voice which I heard [was] as [the voice] of harpers harping with their harps:</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> and they sing as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four living creatures and the elders: and no man could learn the song save the hundred and forty and four thousand, [even] they that had been purchased out of the earth.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> These are they that were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These [are] they that follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were purchased from among men, [to be] the firstfruits unto God and unto the Lamb.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And in their mouth was found no lie: they are without blemish.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And I saw another angel flying in mid heaven, having eternal good tidings to proclaim unto them that dwell on the earth, and unto every nation and tribe and tongue and people;</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> and he saith with a great voice, Fear God, and give him glory; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made the heaven and the earth and sea and fountains of waters.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And another, a second angel, followed, saying, Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, that hath made all the nations to drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a great voice, If any man worshippeth the beast and his image, and receiveth a mark on his forehead, or upon his hand,</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> he also shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is prepared unmixed in the cup of his anger; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> and the smoke of their torment goeth up for ever and ever; and they have no rest day and night, they that worship the beast and his image, and whoso receiveth the mark of his name.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Here is the patience of the saints, they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And I heard the voice from heaven saying, Write, Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from henceforth: yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; for their works follow with them.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And I saw, and behold, a white cloud; and on the cloud [I saw] one sitting like unto a son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand sharp sickle.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And another angel came out from the temple, crying with a great voice to him that sat on the cloud, Send forth thy sickle, and reap: for the hour to reap is come; for the harvest of the earth is ripe.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And he that sat on the cloud cast his sickle upon the earth; and the earth was reaped.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Another angel came out from the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And another angel came out from the altar, he that hath power over fire; and he called with a great voice to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Send forth thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> And the angel cast his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vintage of the earth, and cast it into the winepress, the great [winepress], of the wrath of God.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> And the winepress are trodden without the city, and there came out blood from the winepress, even unto the bridles of the horses, as far as a thousand and six hundred furlongs.</span></div>
