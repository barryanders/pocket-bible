<div><h4>Hosea 5</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Hear this, O ye priests, and hearken, O house of Israel, and give ear, O house of the king; for unto you pertaineth the judgment; for ye have been a snare at Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And the revolters are gone deep in making slaughter; but I am a rebuker of them all.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me; for now, O Ephraim, thou hast played the harlot, Israel is defiled.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Their doings will not suffer them to turn unto their God; for the spirit of whoredom is within them, and they know not Jehovah.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore Israel and Ephraim shall stumble in their iniquity; Judah also shall stumble with them.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek Jehovah; but they shall not find him: he hath withdrawn himself from them.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> They have dealt treacherously against Jehovah; for they have borne strange children: now shall the new moon devour them with their fields.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah: sound an alarm at Beth-aven; behind thee, O Benjamin.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Ephraim shall become a desolation in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> The princes of Judah are like them that remove the landmark: I will pour out my wrath upon them like water.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Ephraim is oppressed, he is crushed in judgment; because he was content to walk after [man's] command.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Therefore am I unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah [saw] his wound, then went Ephraim to Assyria, and sent to king Jareb: but he is not able to heal you, neither will he cure you of your wound.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah: I, even I, will tear and go away; I will carry off, and there shall be none to deliver.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> I will go and return to my place, till they acknowledge their offence, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek me earnestly.</span></div>
