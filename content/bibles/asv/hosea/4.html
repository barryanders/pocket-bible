<div><h4>Hosea 4</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Hear the word of Jehovah, ye children of Israel; for Jehovah hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because there is no truth, nor goodness, nor knowledge of God in the land.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> There is nought but swearing and breaking faith, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery; they break out, and blood toucheth blood.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field and the birds of the heavens; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Yet let no man strive, neither let any man reprove; for thy people are as they that strive with the priest.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And thou shalt stumble in the day, and the prophet also shall stumble with thee in the night; and I will destroy thy mother.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I also will forget thy children.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> As they were multiplied, so they sinned against me: I will change their glory into shame.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> They feed on the sin of my people, and set their heart on their iniquity.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And it shall be, like people, like priest; and I will punish them for their ways, and will requite them their doings.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And they shall eat, and not have enough; they shall play the harlot, and shall not increase; because they have left off taking heed to Jehovah.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the understanding.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> My people ask counsel at their stock, and their staff declareth unto them; for the spirit of whoredom hath caused them to err, and they have played the harlot, [departing] from under their God.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and terebinths, because the shadow thereof is good: therefore your daughters play the harlot, and your brides commit adultery.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> I will not punish your daughters when they play the harlot, nor your brides when they commit adultery; for [the men] themselves go apart with harlots, and they sacrifice with the prostitutes; and the people that doth not understand shall be overthrown.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, yet let not Judah offend; and come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go ye up to Beth-aven, nor swear, As Jehovah liveth.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> For Israel hath behaved himself stubbornly, like a stubborn heifer: now will Jehovah feed them as a lamb in a large place.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Ephraim is joined to idols; let him alone.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Their drink is become sour; they play the harlot continually; her rulers dearly love shame.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> The wind hath wrapped her up in its wings; and they shall be put to shame because of their sacrifices.</span></div>
