and the border turned to Hosah; and the goings out thereof were at the sea by the region of Achzib;</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Ummah also, and Aphek, and Rehob: twenty and two cities with their villages.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families, these cities with their villages.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> The sixth lot came out for the children of Naphtali, even for the children of Naphtali according to their families.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> And their border was from Heleph, from the oak in Zaanannim, and Adaminekeb, and Jabneel, unto Lakkum; and the goings out thereof were at the Jordan;</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> and the border turned westward to Aznoth-tabor, and went out from thence to Hukkok; and it reached to Zebulun on the south, and reached to Asher on the west, and to Judah at the Jordan toward the sunrising.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> And the fortified cities were Ziddim, Zer, and Hammath, Rakkath, and Chinnereth,</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> and Adamah, and Ramah, and Hazor,</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> and Kedesh, and Edrei, and En-hazor,</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> And Iron, and Migdal-el, Horem, and Beth-anath, and Beth-shemesh;

for the children of Dan went up and fought against Leshem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and possessed it, and dwelt therein, and called Leshem, Dan, after the name of Dan their father.</span><span class="48"> <sup>48</sup> This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families, these cities with their villages.</span><span class="49"> <sup>49</sup> So they made an end of distributing the land for inheritance by the borders thereof; and the children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua the son of Nun in the midst of them:</span><span class="50"> <sup>50</sup> according to the commandment of Jehovah they gave him the city which he asked, even Timnath-serah in the hill-country of Ephraim; and he built the city, and dwelt therein.</span><span class="51"> <sup>51</sup> These are the inheritances, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers' [houses] of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed for inheritance by lot in Shiloh before Jehovah, at the door of the tent of meeting. So they made an end of dividing the land.</span></div>
