<div><h4>Nahum 2</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> He that dasheth in pieces is come up against thee: keep the fortress, watch the way, make thy loins strong, fortify thy power mightily.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For Jehovah restoreth the excellency of Jacob, as the excellency of Israel; for the emptiers have emptied them out, and destroyed their vine-branches.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men are in scarlet: the chariots flash with steel in the day of his preparation, and the cypress [spears] are brandished.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> The chariots rage in the streets; they rush to and fro in the broad ways: the appearance of them is like torches; they run like the lightnings.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> He remembereth his nobles: they stumble in their march; they make haste to the wall thereof, and the mantelet is prepared.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> The gates of the rivers are opened, and the palace is dissolved.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And it is decreed: she is uncovered, she is carried away; and her handmaids moan as with the voice of doves, beating upon their breasts.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> But Nineveh hath been from of old like a pool of water: yet they flee away. Stand, stand, [they cry]; but none looketh back.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Take ye the spoil of silver, take the spoil of gold; for there is no end of the store, the glory of all goodly furniture.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> She is empty, and void, and waste; and the heart melteth, and the knees smite together, and anguish is in all loins, and the faces of them all are waxed pale.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Where is the den of the lions, and the feeding-place of the young lions, where the lion [and] the lioness walked, the lion's whelp, and none made them afraid?</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> The lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled his caves with prey, and his dens with ravin.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Behold, I am against thee, saith Jehovah of hosts, and I will burn her chariots in the smoke, and the sword shall devour thy young lions; and I will cut off thy prey from the earth, and the voice of thy messengers shall no more be heard.</span></div>
