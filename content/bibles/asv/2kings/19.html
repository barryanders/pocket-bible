[even] against the Holy One of Israel.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> By thy messengers thou hast defied the Lord, and hast said, With the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains, to the innermost parts of Lebanon; and I will cut down the tall cedars thereof, and the choice fir-trees thereof; and I will enter into his farthest lodging-place, the forest of his fruitful field.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> I have digged and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of my feet will I dry up all the rivers of Egypt.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Hast thou not heard how I have done it long ago, and formed it of ancient times? now have I brought it to pass, that it should be thine to lay waste fortified cities into ruinous heaps.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, and as grain blasted before it is grown up.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> But I know thy sitting down, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy raging against me.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Because of thy raging against me, and because thine arrogancy is come up into mine ears, therefore will I put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> And this shall be the sign unto thee: Ye shall eat this year that which groweth of itself, and in the second year that which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and out of mount Zion they that shall escape: the zeal of Jehovah shall perform this.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come unto this city, nor shoot an arrow there, neither shall he come before it with shield, nor cast up a mound against it.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and he shall not come unto this city, saith Jehovah.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> For I will defend this city to save it, for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> And it came to pass that night, that the angel of Jehovah went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred fourscore and five thousand: and when men arose early in the morning, behold, these were all dead bodies.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer smote him with the sword: and they escaped into the land of Ararat.
