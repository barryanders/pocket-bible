<div><h4>1 Chronicles 17</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And it came to pass, when David dwelt in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of the covenant of Jehovah [dwelleth] under curtains.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And Nathan said unto David, Do all that is in thy heart; for God is with thee.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying,</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith Jehovah, Thou shalt not build me a house to dwell in:</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> for I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up Israel, unto this day, but have gone from tent to tent, and from [one] tabernacle [to another].</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> In all places wherein I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to be shepherd of my people, saying, Why have ye not built me a house of cedar?</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be prince over my people Israel:</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> and I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast gone, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee; and I will make thee a name, like unto the name of the great ones that are in the earth.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the first,</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> and [as] from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel; and I will subdue all thine enemies. Moreover I tell thee that Jehovah will build thee a house.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And it shall come to pass, when thy days are fulfilled that thou must go to be with thy fathers, that I will set up thy seed after thee, who shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> He shall build me a house, and I will establish his throne for ever.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my lovingkindness away from him, as I took it from him that was before thee;</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> but I will settle him in my house and in my kingdom for ever; and his throne shall be established for ever.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Then David the king went in, and sat before Jehovah; and he said, Who am I, O Jehovah God, and what is my house, that thou hast brought me thus far?</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; but thou hast spoken of thy servant's house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O Jehovah God.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> What can David [say] yet more unto thee concerning the honor which is done to thy servant? for thou knowest thy servant.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> O Jehovah, for thy servant's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou wrought all this greatness, to make known all [these] great things.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> O Jehovah, there is none like thee, neither is there any God besides thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> And what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem unto himself for a people, to make thee a name by great and terrible things, in driving out nations from before thy people, whom thou redeemest out of Egypt?</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever; and thou, Jehovah, becamest their God.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> And now, O Jehovah, let the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, be established for ever, and do as thou hast spoken.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> And let thy name be established and magnified for ever, saying, Jehovah of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel: and the house of David thy servant is established before thee.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> For thou, O my God, hast revealed to thy servant that thou wilt build him a house: therefore hath thy servant found [in his heart] to pray before thee.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> And now, O Jehovah, thou art God, and hast promised this good thing unto thy servant:</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> and now it hath pleased thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou, O Jehovah, hast blessed, and it is blessed for ever.</span></div>
