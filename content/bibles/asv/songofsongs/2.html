<div><h4>Song of Songs 2</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> I am a rose of Sharon, A lily of the valleys.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> As a lily among thorns, So is my love among the daughters.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> As the apple-tree among the trees of the wood, So is my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, And his fruit was sweet to my taste.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> He brought me to the banqueting-house, And his banner over me was love.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Stay ye me with raisins, refresh me with apples; For I am sick from love.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> His left hand [is] under my head, And his right hand doth embrace me.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, By the roes, or by the hinds of the field, That ye stir not up, nor awake [my] love, Until he please.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> The voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh, Leaping upon the mountains, Skipping upon the hills.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> My beloved is like a roe or a young hart: Behold, he standeth behind our wall; He looketh in at the windows; He glanceth through the lattice.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For, lo, the winter is past; The rain is over and gone;</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> The flowers appear on the earth; The time of the singing [of birds] is come, And the voice of the turtle-dove is heard in our land;</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> The fig-tree ripeneth her green figs, And the vines are in blossom; They give forth their fragrance. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, In the covert of the steep place, Let me see thy countenance, Let me hear thy voice; For sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Take us the foxes, the little foxes, That spoil the vineyards; For our vineyards are in blossom.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> My beloved is mine, and I am his: He feedeth [his flock] among the lilies.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Until the day be cool, and the shadows flee away, Turn, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart Upon the mountains of Bether.</span></div>
