<div><h4>Philemon 1</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon our beloved and fellow-worker,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> and to Apphia our sister, and to Archippus our fellow-soldier, and to the church in thy house:</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> I thank my God always, making mention of thee in my prayers,</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> hearing of thy love, and of the faith which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all the saints;</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> that the fellowship of thy faith may become effectual, in the knowledge of every good thing which is in you, unto Christ.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For I had much joy and comfort in thy love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through thee, brother.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Wherefore, though I have all boldness in Christ to enjoin thee that which is befitting,</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> yet for love's sake I rather beseech, being such a one as Paul the aged, and now a prisoner also of Christ Jesus:</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> I beseech thee for my child, whom I have begotten in my bonds, Onesimus,</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> who once was unprofitable to thee, but now is profitable to thee and to me:</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> whom I have sent back to thee in his own person, that is, my very heart:</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> whom I would fain have kept with me, that in thy behalf he might minister unto me in the bonds of the gospel:</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> but without thy mind I would do nothing; that thy goodness should not be as of necessity, but of free will.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> For perhaps he was therefore parted [from thee] for a season, that thou shouldest have him for ever;</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> no longer as a servant, but more than a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much rather to thee, both in the flesh and in the Lord.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> If then thou countest me a partner, receive him as myself.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> But if he hath wronged the at all, or oweth [thee] aught, put that to mine account;</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> I Paul write it with mine own hand, I will repay it: that I say not unto thee that thou owest to me even thine own self besides.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my heart in Christ.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Having confidence in thine obedience I write unto thee, knowing that thou wilt do even beyond what I say.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I hope that through your prayers I shall be granted unto you.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Epaphras, my fellow-prisoner in Christ Jesus, saluteth thee;</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> [and so do] Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow-workers.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen. </span></div>
