<div><h4>Acts 6</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Now in these days, when the number of the disciples was multiplying, there arose a murmuring of the Grecian Jews against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them, and said, It is not fit that we should forsake the word of God, and serve tables.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Look ye out therefore, brethren, from among you seven men of good report, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> But we will continue stedfastly in prayer, and in the ministry of the word.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolaus a proselyte of Antioch;</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid their hands upon them.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem exceedingly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And Stephen, full of grace and power, wrought great wonders and signs among the people.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> But there arose certain of them that were of the synagogue called [the synagogue] of the Libertines, and of the Cyrenians, and of the Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia and Asia, disputing with Stephen.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And they were not able to withstand the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spake.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Then they suborned men, who said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses, and [against] God.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon him, and seized him, and brought him into the council,</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> and set up false witnesses, who said, This man ceaseth not to speak words against this holy place, and the law:</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> for we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered unto us.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And all that sat in the council, fastening their eyes on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel.</span></div>
