<div><h4>Acts 4</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And as they spake unto the people, the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came upon them,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> being sore troubled because they taught the people, and proclaimed in Jesus the resurrection from the dead.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And they laid hands on them, and put them in ward unto the morrow: for it was now eventide.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> But many of them that heard the word believed; and the number of the men came to be about five thousand.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers and elders and scribes were gathered together in Jerusalem;</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> and Annas the high priest [was there], and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And when they had set them in the midst, they inquired, By what power, or in what name, have ye done this?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders,</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> if we this day are examined concerning a good deed done to an impotent man, by what means this man is made whole;</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, [even] in him doth this man stand here before you whole.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> He is the stone which was set at nought of you the builders, which was made the head of the corner.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And in none other is there salvation: for neither is there any other name under heaven, that is given among men, wherein we must be saved.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Now when they beheld the boldness of Peter and John, and had perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And seeing the man that was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been wrought through them, is manifest to all that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> But that it spread no further among the people, let us threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And they called them, and charged them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it is right in the sight of God to hearken unto you rather than unto God, judge ye:</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> for we cannot but speak the things which we saw and heard.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> And they, when they had further threatened them, let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people; for all men glorified God for that which was done.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> For the man was more than forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was wrought.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> And being let go, they came to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said unto them.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> And they, when they heard it, lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, O Lord, thou that didst make the heaven and the earth and the sea, and all that in them is:</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> who by the Holy Spirit, [by] the mouth of our father David thy servant, didst say, Why did the Gentiles rage, And the peoples imagine vain things?</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> The kings of the earth set themselves in array, And the rulers were gathered together, Against the Lord, and against his Anointed:</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> for of a truth in this city against thy holy Servant Jesus, whom thou didst anoint, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, were gathered together,</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> to do whatsoever thy hand and thy council foreordained to come to pass.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> And now, Lord, look upon their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants to speak thy word with all boldness,</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> while thy stretchest forth thy hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done through the name of thy holy Servant Jesus.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> And when they had prayed, the place was shaken wherein they were gathered together; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spake the word of God with boldness.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and soul: and not one [of them] said that aught of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> And with great power gave the apostles their witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> For neither was there among them any that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> and laid them at the apostles' feet: and distribution was made unto each, according as any one had need.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> And Joseph, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas (which is, being interpreted, Son of exhortation), a Levite, a man of Cyprus by race,</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> having a field, sold it, and brought the money and laid it at the apostles' feet.</span></div>
