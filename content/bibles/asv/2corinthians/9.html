<div><h4>2 Corinthians 9</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you:</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> for I know your readiness, of which I glory on your behalf to them of Macedonia, that Achaia hath been prepared for a year past; and your zeal hath stirred up very many of them.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> But I have sent the brethren, that our glorying on your behalf may not be made void in this respect; that, even as I said, ye may be prepared:</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> lest by any means, if there come with me any of Macedonia and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be put to shame in this confidence.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> I thought it necessary therefore to entreat the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your aforepromised bounty, that the same might be ready as a matter of bounty, and not of extortion.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> But this [I say,] He that soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he that soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> [Let] each man [do] according as he hath purposed in his heart: not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And God is able to make all grace abound unto you; that ye, having always all sufficiency in everything, may abound unto every good work:</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> as it is written, He hath scattered abroad, he hath given to the poor; His righteousness abideth for ever.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And he that supplieth seed to the sower and bread for food, shall supply and multiply your seed for sowing, and increase the fruits of your righteousness:</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> ye being enriched in everything unto all liberality, which worketh through us thanksgiving to God.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> For the ministration of this service not only filleth up the measure of the wants of the saints, but aboundeth also through many thanksgivings unto God;</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> seeing that through the proving [of you] by this ministration they glorify God for the obedience of your confession unto the gospel of Christ, and for the liberality of [your] contribution unto them and unto all;</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> while they themselves also, with supplication on your behalf, long after you by reason of the exceeding grace of God in you.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift.</span></div>
