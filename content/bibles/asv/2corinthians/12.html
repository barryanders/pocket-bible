<div><h4>2 Corinthians 12</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> I must needs glory, though it is not expedient; but I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago (whether in the body, I know not; or whether out of the body, I know not; God knoweth), such a one caught up even to the third heaven.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And I know such a man (whether in the body, or apart from the body, I know not; God knoweth),</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> how that he was caught up into Paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> On behalf of such a one will I glory: but on mine own behalf I will not glory, save in [my] weaknesses.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For if I should desire to glory, I shall not be foolish; for I shall speak the truth: but I forbear, lest any man should account of me above that which he seeth me [to be], or heareth from me.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And by reason of the exceeding greatness of the revelations, that I should not be exalted overmuch, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet me, that I should not be exalted overmuch.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Concerning this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And he hath said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for [my] power is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Wherefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in injuries, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> I am become foolish: ye compelled me; for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing was I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I am nothing.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, by signs and wonders and mighty works.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> For what is there wherein ye were made inferior to the rest of the churches, except [it be] that I myself was not a burden to you? forgive me this wrong.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Behold, this is the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be a burden to you: for I seek not yours, but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls. If I love you more abundantly, am I loved the less?</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> But be it so, I did not myself burden you; but, being crafty, I caught you with guile.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Did I take advantage of you by any one of them whom I have sent unto you?</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> I exhorted Titus, and I sent the brother with him. Did Titus take any advantage of you? walked we not in the same spirit? [walked we] not in the same steps?</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Ye think all this time that we are excusing ourselves unto you. In the sight of God speak we in Christ. But all things, beloved, [are] for your edifying.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> For I fear, lest by any means, when I come, I should find you not such as I would, and should myself be found of you such as ye would not; lest by any means [there should be] strife, jealousy, wraths, factions, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults;</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> lest again when I come my God should humble me before you, and I should mourn for many of them that have sinned heretofore, and repented not of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they committed.</span></div>
