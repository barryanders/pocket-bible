<div><h4>2 Corinthians 3</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Are we beginning again to commend ourselves? or need we, as do some, epistles of commendation to you or from you?</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Ye are our epistle, written in our hearts, known and read of all men;</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> being made manifest that ye are an epistle of Christ, ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in tables [that are] hearts of flesh.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And such confidence have we through Christ to God-ward:</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> not that we are sufficient of ourselves, to account anything as from ourselves; but our sufficiency is from God;</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> who also made us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> But if the ministration of death, written, [and] engraven on stones, came with glory, so that the children of Israel could not look stedfastly upon the face of Moses for the glory of his face; which [glory] was passing away:</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> how shall not rather the ministration of the spirit be with glory?</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For if the ministration of condemnation hath glory, much rather doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For verily that which hath been made glorious hath not been made glorious in this respect, by reason of the glory that surpasseth.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For if that which passeth away [was] with glory, much more that which remaineth [is] in glory.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Having therefore such a hope, we use great boldness of speech,</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> and [are] not as Moses, [who] put a veil upon his face, that the children of Israel should not look stedfastly on the end of that which was passing away:</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> but their minds were hardened: for until this very day at the reading of the old covenant the same veil remaineth, it not being revealed [to them] that it is done away in Christ.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> But unto this day, whensoever Moses is read, a veil lieth upon their heart.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> But whensoever it shall turn to the Lord, the veil is taken away.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Now the Lord is the Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, [there] is liberty.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> But we all, with unveiled face beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord the Spirit.</span></div>
