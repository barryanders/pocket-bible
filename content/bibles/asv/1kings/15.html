<div><h4>1 Kings 15</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat began Abijam to reign over Judah.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Three years reigned he in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him; and his heart was not perfect with Jehovah his God, as the heart of David his father.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Nevertheless for David's sake did Jehovah his God give him a lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to establish Jerusalem;</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> because David did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, and turned not aside from anything that he commanded him all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Now there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
