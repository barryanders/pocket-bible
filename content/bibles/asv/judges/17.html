<div><h4>Judges 17</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And there was a man of the hill-country of Ephraim, whose name was Micah.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred [pieces] of silver that were taken from thee, about which thou didst utter a curse, and didst also speak it in mine ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed be my son of Jehovah.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And he restored the eleven hundred [pieces] of silver to his mother; and his mother said, I verily dedicate the silver unto Jehovah from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image: now therefore I will restore it unto thee.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And when he restored the money unto his mother, his mother took two hundred [pieces] of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made thereof a graven image and a molten image: and it was in the house of Micah.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And the man Micah had a house of gods, and he made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And there was a young man out of Beth-lehem-judah, of the family of Judah, who was a Levite; and he sojourned there.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And the man departed out of the city, out of Beth-lehem-judah, to sojourn where he could find [a place], and he came to the hill-country of Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto him, I am a Levite of Beth-lehem-judah, and I go to sojourn where I may find [a place].</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a father and a priest, and I will give thee ten [pieces] of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals. So the Levite went in.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was unto him as one of his sons.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And Micah consecrated the Levite, and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Then said Micah, Now know I that Jehovah will do me good, seeing I have a Levite to my priest.</span></div>
