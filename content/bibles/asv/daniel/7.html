<div><h4>Daniel 7</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream and told the sum of the matters.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of heaven brake forth upon the great sea.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made to stand upon two feet as a man; and a man's heart was given to it.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And, behold, another beast, a second, like to a bear; and it was raised up on one side, and three ribs were in its mouth between its teeth: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much flesh.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> After this I beheld, and, lo, another, like a leopard, which had upon its back four wings of a bird; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> After this I saw in the night-visions, and, behold, a fourth beast, terrible and powerful, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth; it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> I beheld till thrones were placed, and one that was ancient of days did sit: his raiment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool; his throne was fiery flames, [and] the wheels thereof burning fire.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousands of thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> I beheld at that time because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake; I beheld even till the beast was slain, and its body destroyed, and it was given to be burned with fire.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And as for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> I saw in the night-visions, and, behold, there came with the clouds of heaven one like unto a son of man, and he came even to the ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all the peoples, nations, and languages should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> As for me, Daniel, my spirit was grieved in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth concerning all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, that shall arise out of the earth.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> But the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Then I desired to know the truth concerning the fourth beast, which was diverse from all of them, exceeding terrible, whose teeth were of iron, and its nails of brass; which devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet;</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> and concerning the ten horns that were on its head, and the other [horn] which came up, and before which three fell, even that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spake great things, whose look was more stout than its fellows.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> until the ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the Most High, and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be a fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all the kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> And as for the ten horns, out of this kingdom shall ten kings arise: and another shall arise after them; and he shall be diverse from the former, and he shall put down three kings.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> And he shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High; and he shall think to change the times and the law; and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and half a time.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> But the judgment shall be set, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> And the kingdom and the dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High: his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Here is the end of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts much troubled me, and my countenance was changed in me: but I kept the matter in my heart.</span></div>
