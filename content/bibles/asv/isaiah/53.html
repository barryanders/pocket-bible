<div><h4>Isaiah 53</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Who hath believed our message? and to whom hath the arm of Jehovah been revealed?</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For he grew up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> He was despised, and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and as one from whom men hide their face he was despised; and we esteemed him not.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows; yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and Jehovah hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> He was oppressed, yet when he was afflicted he opened not his mouth; as a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and as a sheep that before its shearers is dumb, so he opened not his mouth.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> By oppression and judgment he was taken away; and as for his generation, who [among them] considered that he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people to whom the stroke [was due]?</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And they made his grave with the wicked, and with a rich man in his death; although he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Yet it pleased Jehovah to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see [his] seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of Jehovah shall prosper in his hand.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> He shall see of the travail of his soul, [and] shall be satisfied: by the knowledge of himself shall my righteous servant justify many; and he shall bear their iniquities.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he poured out his soul unto death, and was numbered with the transgressors: yet he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.</span></div>
