<div><h4>Isaiah 40</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem; and cry unto her, that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned, that she hath received of Jehovah's hand double for all her sins.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> The voice of one that crieth, Prepare ye in the wilderness the way of Jehovah; make level in the desert a highway for our God.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low; and the uneven shall be made level, and the rough places a plain:</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> and the glory of Jehovah shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together; for the mouth of Jehovah hath spoken it.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> The voice of one saying, Cry. And one said, What shall I cry? All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> The grass withereth, the flower fadeth, because the breath of Jehovah bloweth upon it; surely the people is grass.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> The grass withereth, the flower fadeth; but the word of our God shall stand forever.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> O thou that tellest good tidings to Zion, get thee up on a high mountain; O thou that tellest good tidings to Jerusalem, lift up thy voice with strength; lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the cities of Judah, Behold, your God!</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Behold, the Lord Jehovah will come as a mighty one, and his arm will rule for him: Behold, his reward is with him, and his recompense before him.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> He will feed his flock like a shepherd, he will gather the lambs in his arm, and carry them in his bosom, [and] will gently lead those that have their young.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Who hath directed the Spirit of Jehovah, or being his counsellor hath taught him?</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> With whom took he counsel, and who instructed him, and taught him in the path of justice, and taught him knowledge, and showed to him the way of understanding?</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are accounted as the small dust of the balance: Behold, he taketh up the isles as a very little thing.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt-offering.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> All the nations are as nothing before him; they are accounted by him as less than nothing, and vanity.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> To whom then will ye liken God? or what likeness will ye compare unto him?</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> The image, a workman hath cast [it], and the goldsmith overlayeth it with gold, and casteth [for it] silver chains.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> He that is too impoverished for [such] an oblation chooseth a tree that will not rot; he seeketh unto him a skilful workman to set up a graven image, that shall not be moved.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Have ye not known? have yet not heard? hath it not been told you from the beginning? have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth?</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> [It is] he that sitteth above the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in;</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> that bringeth princes to nothing; that maketh the judges of the earth as vanity.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Yea, they have not been planted; yea, they have not been sown; yea, their stock hath not taken root in the earth: moreover he bloweth upon them, and they wither, and the whirlwind taketh them away as stubble.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> To whom then will ye liken me, that I should be equal [to him]? saith the Holy One.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Lift up your eyes on high, and see who hath created these, that bringeth out their host by number; he calleth them all by name; by the greatness of his might, and for that he is strong in power, not one is lacking.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O Israel, My way is hid from Jehovah, and the justice [due] to me is passed away from my God?</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard? The everlasting God, Jehovah, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary; there is no searching of his understanding.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> He giveth power to the faint; and to him that hath no might he increaseth strength.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall:</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> but they that wait for Jehovah shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; they shall walk, and not faint.</span></div>
