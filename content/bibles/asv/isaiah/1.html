<div><h4>Isaiah 1</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth; for Jehovah hath spoken: I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib; [but] Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evil-doers, children that deal corruptly! they have forsaken Jehovah, they have despised the Holy One of Israel, they are estranged [and gone] backward.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Why will ye be still stricken, that ye revolt more and more? the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; [but] wounds, and bruises, and fresh stripes: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with oil.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Your country is desolate; your cities are burned with fire; your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And the daughter of Zion is left as a booth in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Except Jehovah of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, we should have been like unto Gomorrah.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Hear the word of Jehovah, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> What unto me is the multitude of your sacrifices? saith Jehovah: I have had enough of the burnt-offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he-goats.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to trample my courts?</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; new moon and sabbath, the calling of assemblies,- I cannot away with iniquity and the solemn meeting.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth; they are a trouble unto me; I am weary of bearing them.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you; yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> learn to do well; seek justice, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Come now, and let us reason together, saith Jehovah: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> but if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword; for the mouth of Jehovah hath spoken it.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> How is the faithful city become a harlot! she that was full of justice! righteousness lodged in her, but now murderers.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Thy princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves; every one loveth bribes, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Therefore saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies;</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> and I will turn my hand upon thee, and thoroughly purge away thy dross, and will take away all thy tin;</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> and I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called The city of righteousness, a faithful town.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Zion shall be redeemed with justice, and her converts with righteousness.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> But the destruction of transgressors and sinners shall be together, and they that forsake Jehovah shall be consumed.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no water.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> And the strong shall be as tow, and his work as a spark; and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench them.</span></div>
