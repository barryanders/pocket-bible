<div><h4>Isaiah 42</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Behold, my servant, whom I uphold; my chosen, in whom my soul delighteth: I have put my Spirit upon him; he will bring forth justice to the Gentiles.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> He will not cry, nor lift up his voice, nor cause it to be heard in the street.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> A bruised reed will he not break, and a dimly burning wick will he not quench: he will bring forth justice in truth.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> He will not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set justice in the earth; and the isles shall wait for his law.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Thus saith God Jehovah, he that created the heavens, and stretched them forth; he that spread abroad the earth and that which cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein:</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> I, Jehovah, have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thy hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles;</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> to open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the dungeon, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison-house.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> I am Jehovah, that is my name; and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise unto graven images.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Behold, the former things are come to pass, and new things do I declare; before they spring forth I tell you of them.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Sing unto Jehovah a new song, and his praise from the end of the earth; ye that go down to the sea, and all that is therein, the isles, and the inhabitants thereof.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up [their voice], the villages that Kedar doth inhabit; let the inhabitants of Sela sing, let them shout from the top of the mountains.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Let them give glory unto Jehovah, and declare his praise in the islands.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Jehovah will go forth as a mighty man; he will stir up [his] zeal like a man of war: he will cry, yea, he will shout aloud; he will do mightily against his enemies.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> I have long time holden my peace; I have been still, and refrained myself: [now] will I cry out like a travailing woman; I will gasp and pant together.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> I will lay waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbs; and I will make the rivers islands, and will dry up the pools.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And I will bring the blind by a way that they know not; in paths that they know not will I lead them; I will make darkness light before them, and crooked places straight. These things will I do, and I will not forsake them.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> They shall be turned back, they shall be utterly put to shame, that trust in graven images, that say unto molten images, Ye are our gods.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Hear, ye deaf; and look, ye blind, that ye may see.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Who is blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger that I send? who is blind as he that is at peace [with me], and blind as Jehovah's servant?</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Thou seest many things, but thou observest not; his ears are open, but he heareth not.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> It pleased Jehovah, for his righteousness' sake, to magnify the law, and make it honorable.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> But this is a people robbed and plundered; they are all of them snared in holes, and they are hid in prison-houses: they are for a prey, and none delivereth; for a spoil, and none saith, Restore.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Who is there among you that will give ear to this? that will hearken and hear for the time to come?</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers? did not Jehovah? he against whom we have sinned, and in whose ways they would not walk, neither were they obedient unto his law.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Therefore he poured upon him the fierceness of his anger, and the strength of battle; and it set him on fire round about, yet he knew not; and it burned him, yet he laid it not to heart.</span></div>
