<div><h4>Isaiah 29</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Ho Ariel, Ariel, the city where David encamped! add ye year to year; let the feasts come round:</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> then will I distress Ariel, and there shall be mourning and lamentation; and she shall be unto me as Ariel.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And I will encamp against thee round about, and will lay siege against thee with posted troops, and I will raise siege works against thee.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And thou shalt be brought down, and shalt speak out of the ground, and thy speech shall be low out of the dust; and thy voice shall be as of one that hath a familiar spirit, out of the ground, and thy speech shall whisper out of the dust.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> But the multitude of thy foes shall be like small dust, and the multitude of the terrible ones as chaff that passeth away: yea, it shall be in an instant suddenly.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> She shall be visited of Jehovah of hosts with thunder, and with earthquake, and great noise, with whirlwind and tempest, and the flame of a devouring fire.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel, even all that fight against her and her stronghold, and that distress her, shall be as a dream, a vision of the night.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And it shall be as when a hungry man dreameth, and, behold, he eateth; but he awaketh, and his soul is empty: or as when a thirsty man dreameth, and, behold, he drinketh; but he awaketh, and, behold, he is faint, and his soul hath appetite: so shall the multitude of all the nations be, that fight against mount Zion.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Tarry ye and wonder; take your pleasure and be blind: they are drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For Jehovah hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and hath closed your eyes, the prophets; and your heads, the seers, hath he covered.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And all vision is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee; and he saith, I cannot, for it is sealed:</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> and the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee; and he saith, I am not learned.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw nigh [unto me], and with their mouth and with their lips to honor me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear of me is a commandment of men which hath been taught [them];</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people, even a marvellous work and a wonder; and the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Woe unto them that hide deep their counsel from Jehovah, and whose works are in the dark, and that say, Who seeth us? and who knoweth us?</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Ye turn things upside down! Shall the potter be esteemed as clay; that the thing made should say of him that made it, He made me not; or the thing formed say of him that formed it, He hath no understanding?</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Is it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest?</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity and out of darkness.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> The meek also shall increase their joy in Jehovah, and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> For the terrible one is brought to nought, and the scoffer ceaseth, and all they that watch for iniquity are cut off;</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> that make a man an offender in [his] cause, and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate, and turn aside the just with a thing of nought.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Therefore thus saith Jehovah, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob: Jacob shall not now be ashamed, neither shall his face now wax pale.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> But when he seeth his children, the work of my hands, in the midst of him, they shall sanctify my name; yea, they shall sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shall stand in awe of the God of Israel.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> They also that err in spirit shall come to understanding, and they that murmur shall receive instruction.</span></div>
