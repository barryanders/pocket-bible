<div><h4>Isaiah 34</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Come near, ye nations, to hear; and hearken, ye peoples: let the earth hear, and the fulness thereof; the world, and all things that come forth from it.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For Jehovah hath indignation against all the nations, and wrath against all their host: he hath utterly destroyed them, he hath delivered them to the slaughter.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Their slain also shall be cast out, and the stench of their dead bodies shall come up; and the mountains shall be melted with their blood.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll; and all their host shall fade away, as the leaf fadeth from off the vine, and as a fading [leaf] from the fig-tree.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For my sword hath drunk its fill in heaven: behold, it shall come down upon Edom, and upon the people of my curse, to judgment.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> The sword of Jehovah is filled with blood, it is made fat with fatness, with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams; for Jehovah hath a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Edom.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And the wild-oxen shall come down with them, and the bullocks with the bulls: and their land shall be drunken with blood, and their dust made fat with fatness.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> For Jehovah hath a day of vengeance, a year of recompense for the cause of Zion.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And the streams of [Edom] shall be turned into pitch, and the dust thereof into brimstone, and the land thereof shall become burning pitch.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> It shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof shall go up for ever; from generation to generation it shall lie waste; none shall pass through it for ever and ever.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> But the pelican and the porcupine shall possess it; and the owl and the raven shall dwell therein: and he will stretch over it the line of confusion, and the plummet of emptiness.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> They shall call the nobles thereof to the kingdom, but none shall be there; and all its princes shall be nothing.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And thorns shall come up in its palaces, nettles and thistles in the fortresses thereof; and it shall be a habitation of jackals, a court for ostriches.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And the wild beasts of the desert shall meet with the wolves, and the wild goat shall cry to his fellow; yea, the night-monster shall settle there, and shall find her a place of rest.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> There shall the dart-snake make her nest, and lay, and hatch, and gather under her shade; yea, there shall the kites be gathered, every one with her mate.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Seek ye out of the book of Jehovah, and read: no one of these shall be missing, none shall want her mate; for my mouth, it hath commanded, and his Spirit, it hath gathered them.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And he hath cast the lot for them, and his hand hath divided it unto them by line: they shall possess it for ever; from generation to generation shall they dwell therein.</span></div>
