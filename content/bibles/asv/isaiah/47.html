<div><h4>Isaiah 47</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Come down, and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon; sit on the ground without a throne, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called tender and delicate.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Take the millstones, and grind meal; remove thy veil, strip off the train, uncover the leg, pass through the rivers.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Thy nakedness shall be uncovered, yea, thy shame shall be seen: I will take vengeance, and will spare no man.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Our Redeemer, Jehovah of hosts is his name, the Holy One of Israel.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Sit thou silent, and get thee into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans; for thou shalt no more be called The mistress of kingdoms.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> I was wroth with my people, I profaned mine inheritance, and gave them into thy hand: thou didst show them no mercy; upon the aged hast thou very heavily laid thy yoke.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And thou saidst, I shall be mistress for ever; so that thou didst not lay these things to thy heart, neither didst remember the latter end thereof.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Now therefore hear this, thou that art given to pleasures, that sittest securely, that sayest in thy heart, I am, and there is none else besides me; I shall not sit as a widow, neither shall I know the loss of children:</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> but these two things shall come to thee in a moment in one day, the loss of children, and widowhood; in their full measure shall they come upon thee, in the multitude of thy sorceries, and the great abundance of thine enchantments.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For thou hast trusted in thy wickedness; thou hast said, None seeth me; thy wisdom and thy knowledge, it hath perverted thee, and thou hast said in thy heart, I am, and there is none else besides me.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Therefore shall evil come upon thee; thou shalt not know the dawning thereof: and mischief shall fall upon thee; thou shalt not be able to put it away: and desolation shall come upon thee suddenly, which thou knowest not.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Stand now with thine enchantments, and with the multitude of thy sorceries, wherein thou hast labored from thy youth; if so be thou shalt be able to profit, if so be thou mayest prevail.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels: let now the astrologers, the star-gazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up, and save thee from the things that shall come upon thee.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame: it shall not be a coal to warm at, nor a fire to sit before.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Thus shall the things be unto thee wherein thou hast labored: they that have trafficked with thee from thy youth shall wander every one to his quarter; there shall be none to save thee.</span></div>
