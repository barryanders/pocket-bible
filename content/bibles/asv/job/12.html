<div><h4>Job 12</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Then Job answered and said,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> No doubt but ye are the people, And wisdom shall die with you.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you: Yea, who knoweth not such things as these?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> I am as one that is a laughing-stock to his neighbor, I who called upon God, and he answered: The just, the perfect man is a laughing-stock.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> In the thought of him that is at ease there is contempt for misfortune; It is ready for them whose foot slippeth.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> The tents of robbers prosper, And they that provoke God are secure; Into whose hand God bringeth [abundantly].</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; And the birds of the heavens, and they shall tell thee:</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee; And the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Who knoweth not in all these, That the hand of Jehovah hath wrought this,</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, And the breath of all mankind?</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Doth not the ear try words, Even as the palate tasteth its food?</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> With aged men is wisdom, And in length of days understanding.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> With [God] is wisdom and might; He hath counsel and understanding.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again; He shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up; Again, he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> With him is strength and wisdom; The deceived and the deceiver are his.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> He leadeth counsellors away stripped, And judges maketh he fools.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> He looseth the bond of kings, And he bindeth their loins with a girdle.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> He leadeth priests away stripped, And overthroweth the mighty.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> He removeth the speech of the trusty, And taketh away the understanding of the elders.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> He poureth contempt upon princes, And looseth the belt of the strong.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> He uncovereth deep things out of darkness, And bringeth out to light the shadow of death.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> He increaseth the nations, and he destroyeth them: He enlargeth the nations, and he leadeth them captive.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> He taketh away understanding from the chiefs of the people of the earth, And causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> They grope in the dark without light; And he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man.</span></div>
