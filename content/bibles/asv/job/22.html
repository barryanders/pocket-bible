<div><h4>Job 22</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Can a man be profitable unto God? Surely he that is wise is profitable unto himself.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? Or is it gain [to him], that thou makest thy ways perfect?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Is it for thy fear [of him] that he reproveth thee, That he entereth with thee into judgment?</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Is not thy wickedness great? Neither is there any end to thine iniquities.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For thou hast taken pledges of thy brother for nought, And stripped the naked of their clothing.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, And thou hast withholden bread from the hungry.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> But as for the mighty man, he had the earth; And the honorable man, he dwelt in it.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Thou hast sent widows away empty, And the arms of the fatherless have been broken.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Therefore snares are round about thee, And sudden fear troubleth thee,</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Or darkness, so that thou canst not see, And abundance of waters cover thee.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Is not God in the height of heaven? And behold the height of the stars, how high they are!</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And thou sayest, What doth God know? Can he judge through the thick darkness?</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Thick clouds are a covering to him, so that he seeth not; And he walketh on the vault of heaven.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Wilt thou keep the old way Which wicked men have trodden?</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Who were snatched away before their time, Whose foundation was poured out as a stream,</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Who said unto God, Depart from us; And, What can the Almighty do for us?</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Yet he filled their houses with good things: But the counsel of the wicked is far from me.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> The righteous see it, and are glad; And the innocent laugh them to scorn,</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> [Saying], Surely they that did rise up against us are cut off, And the remnant of them the fire hath consumed.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: Thereby good shall come unto thee.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, And lay up his words in thy heart.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, If thou put away unrighteousness far from thy tents.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> And lay thou [thy] treasure in the dust, And [the gold of] Ophir among the stones of the brooks;</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> And the Almighty will be thy treasure, And precious silver unto thee.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> For then shalt thou delight thyself in the Almighty, And shalt lift up thy face unto God.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he will hear thee; And thou shalt pay thy vows.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee; And light shall shine upon thy ways.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> When they cast [thee] down, thou shalt say, [There is] lifting up; And the humble person he will save.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> He will deliver [even] him that is not innocent: Yea, he shall be delivered through the cleanness of thy hands.</span></div>
