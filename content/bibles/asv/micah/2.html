<div><h4>Micah 2</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Woe to them that devise iniquity and work evil upon their beds! when the morning is light, they practise it, because it is in the power of their hand.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And they covet fields, and seize them; and houses, and take them away: and they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Therefore thus saith Jehovah: Behold, against this family do I devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks, neither shall ye walk haughtily; for it is an evil time.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> In that day shall they take up a parable against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation, [and] say, We are utterly ruined: he changeth the portion of my people: how doth he remove [it] from me! to the rebellious he divideth our fields.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast the line by lot in the assembly of Jehovah.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Prophesy ye not, [thus] they prophesy. They shall not prophesy to these: reproaches shall not depart.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Shall it be said, O house of Jacob, Is the Spirit of Jehovah straitened? are these his doings? Do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> But of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye strip the robe from off the garment from them that pass by securely [as men] averse from war.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> The women of my people ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their young children ye take away my glory for ever.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Arise ye, and depart; for this is not your resting-place; because of uncleanness that destroyeth, even with a grievous destruction.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> If a man walking in a spirit of falsehood do lie, [saying], I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, as a flock in the midst of their pasture; they shall make great noise by reason of [the multitude of] men.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> The breaker is gone up before them: they have broken forth and passed on to the gate, and are gone out thereat; and their king is passed on before them, and Jehovah at the head of them.</span></div>
