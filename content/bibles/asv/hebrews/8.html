<div><h4>Hebrews 8</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Now in the things which we are saying the chief point [is this]: We have such a high priest, who sat down on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> a minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is necessary that this [high priest] also have somewhat to offer.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Now if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, seeing there are those who offer the gifts according to the law;</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> who serve [that which is] a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, even as Moses is warned [of God] when he is about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern that was showed thee in the mount.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> But now hath he obtained a ministry the more excellent, by so much as he is also the mediator of a better covenant, which hath been enacted upon better promises.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For if that first [covenant] had been faultless, then would no place have been sought for a second.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, That I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah;</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers In the day that I took them by the hand to lead them forth out of the land of Egypt; For they continued not in my covenant, And I regarded them not, saith the Lord.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel After those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, And on their heart also will I write them: And I will be to them a God, And they shall be to me a people:</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And they shall not teach every man his fellow-citizen, And every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: For all shall know me, From the least to the greatest of them.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> For I will be merciful to their iniquities, And their sins will I remember no more.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> In that he saith, A new [covenant] he hath made the first old. But that which is becoming old and waxeth aged is nigh unto vanishing away.</span></div>
