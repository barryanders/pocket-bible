<div><h4>Jeremiah 6</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Flee for safety, ye children of Benjamin, out of the midst of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and raise up a signal on Beth-haccherem; for evil looketh forth from the north, and a great destruction.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> The comely and delicate one, the daughter of Zion, will I cut off.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Shepherds with their flocks shall come unto her; they shall pitch their tents against her round about; they shall feed every one in his place.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Prepare ye war against her; arise, and let us go up at noon. Woe unto us! for the day declineth, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Arise, and let us go up by night, and let us destroy her palaces.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For thus hath Jehovah of hosts said, Hew ye down trees, and cast up a mound against Jerusalem: this is the city to be visited; she is wholly oppression in the midst of her.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> As a well casteth forth its waters, so she casteth forth her wickedness: violence and destruction is heard in her; before me continually is sickness and wounds.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul be alienated from thee; lest I make thee a desolation, a land not inhabited.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, They shall thoroughly glean the remnant of Israel as a vine: turn again thy hand as a grape-gatherer into the baskets.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> To whom shall I speak and testify, that they may hear? behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken: behold, the word of Jehovah is become unto them a reproach; they have no delight in it.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Therefore I am full of the wrath of Jehovah; I am weary with holding in: pour it out upon the children in the street, and upon the assembly of young men together; for even the husband with the wife shall be taken, the aged with him that is full of days.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And their houses shall be turned unto others, their fields and their wives together; for I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land, saith Jehovah.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one is given to covetousness; and from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> They have healed also the hurt of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore they shall fall among them that fall; at the time that I visit them they shall be cast down, saith Jehovah.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Thus saith Jehovah, Stand ye in the ways and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way; and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls: but they said, We will not walk [therein].</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And I set watchmen over you, [saying], Hearken to the sound of the trumpet; but they said, We will not hearken.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Therefore hear, ye nations, and know, O congregation, what is among them.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil upon this people, even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not hearkened unto my words; and as for my law, they have rejected it.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> To what purpose cometh there to me frankincense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far country? your burnt-offerings are not acceptable, nor your sacrifices pleasing unto me.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Therefore thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will lay stumbling-blocks before this people; and the fathers and the sons together shall stumble against them; the neighbor and his friend shall perish.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, a people cometh from the north country; and a great nation shall be stirred up from the uttermost parts of the earth.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> They lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roareth like the sea, and they ride upon horses, every one set in array, as a man to the battle, against thee, O daughter of Zion.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> We have heard the report thereof; our hands wax feeble: anguish hath taken hold of us, [and] pangs as of a woman in travail.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Go not forth into the field, nor walk by the way; for the sword of the enemy, [and] terror, are on every side.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> O daughter of my people, gird thee with sackcloth, and wallow thyself in ashes: make thee mourning, as for an only son, most bitter lamentation; for the destroyer shall suddenly come upon us.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> I have made thee a trier [and] a fortress among my people; that thou mayest know and try their way.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> They are all grievous revolters, going about with slanders; they are brass and iron: they all of them deal corruptly.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> The bellows blow fiercely; the lead is consumed of the fire: in vain do they go on refining; for the wicked are not plucked away.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Refuse silver shall men them, because Jehovah hath rejected them.</span></div>
