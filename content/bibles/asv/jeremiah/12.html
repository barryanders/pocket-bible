<div><h4>Jeremiah 12</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Righteous art thou, O Jehovah, when I contend with thee; yet would I reason the cause with thee: wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper? wherefore are all they at ease that deal very treacherously?</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Thou hast planted them, yea, they have taken root; they grow, yea, they bring forth fruit: thou art near in their mouth, and far from their heart.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> But thou, O Jehovah, knowest me; thou seest me, and triest my heart toward thee: pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and prepare them for the day of slaughter.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of the whole country wither? for the wickedness of them that dwell therein, the beasts are consumed, and the birds; because they said, He shall not see our latter end.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee, then how canst thou contend with horses? and though in a land of peace thou art secure, yet how wilt thou do in the pride of the Jordan?</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For even thy brethren, and the house of thy father, even they have dealt treacherously with thee; even they have cried aloud after thee: believe them not, though they speak fair words unto thee.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> I have forsaken my house, I have cast off my heritage; I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> My heritage is become unto me as a lion in the forest: she hath uttered her voice against me; therefore I have hated her.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Is my heritage unto me as a speckled bird of prey? are the birds of prey against her round about? go ye, assemble all the beasts of the field, bring them to devour.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my portion under foot, they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> They have made it a desolation; it mourneth unto me, being desolate; the whole land is made desolate, because no man layeth it to heart.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Destroyers are come upon all the bare heights in the wilderness; for the sword of Jehovah devoureth from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land: no flesh hath peace.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> They have sown wheat, and have reaped thorns; they have put themselves to pain, and profit nothing: and ye shall be ashamed of your fruits, because of the fierce anger of Jehovah.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Thus saith Jehovah against all mine evil neighbors, that touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit: behold, I will pluck them up from off their land, and will pluck up the house of Judah from among them.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And it shall come to pass, after that I have plucked them up, I will return and have compassion on them; and I will bring them again, every man to his heritage, and every man to his land.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, As Jehovah liveth; even as they taught my people to swear by Baal; then shall they be built up in the midst of my people.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> But if they will not hear, then will I pluck up that nation, plucking up and destroying it, saith Jehovah.</span></div>
