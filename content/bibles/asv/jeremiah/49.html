<div><h4>Jeremiah 49</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Of the children of Ammon. Thus saith Jehovah: Hath Israel no sons? hath he no heir? why then doth Malcam possess Gad, and his people well in the cities thereof?</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Therefore, behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will cause an alarm of war to be heard against Rabbah of the children of Ammon; and it shall become a desolate heap, and her daughters shall be burned with fire: then shall Israel possess them that did possess him, saith Jehovah.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Wail, O Heshbon, for Ai is laid waste; cry, ye daughters of Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth: lament, and run to and fro among the fences; for Malcam shall go into captivity, his priests and his princes together.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys, thy flowing valley, O backsliding daughter? that trusted in her treasures, [saying], Who shall come unto me?</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Behold, I will bring a fear upon thee, saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, from all that are round about thee; and ye shall be driven out every man right forth, and there shall be none to gather together the fugitives.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> But afterward I will bring back the captivity of the children of Ammon, saith Jehovah.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Of Edom. Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Is wisdom no more in Teman? is counsel perished from the prudent? is their wisdom vanished?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Flee ye, turn back, dwell in the depths, O inhabitants of Dedan; for I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him, the time that I shall visit him.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> If grape-gatherers came to thee, would they not leave some gleaning grapes? if thieves by night, would they not destroy till they had enough?</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places, and he shall not be able to hide himself: his seed is destroyed, and his brethren, and his neighbors; and he is not.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve them alive; and let thy widows trust in me.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> For thus saith Jehovah: Behold, they to whom it pertained not to drink of the cup shall assuredly drink; and art thou he that shall altogether go unpunished? thou shalt not go unpunished, but thou shalt surely drink.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> For I have sworn by myself, saith Jehovah, that Bozrah shall become an astonishment, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> I have heard tidings from Jehovah, and an ambassador is sent among the nations, [saying], Gather yourselves together, and come against her, and rise up to the battle.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> For, behold, I have made thee small among the nations, and despised among men.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> As for thy terribleness, the pride of thy heart hath deceived thee, O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, that holdest the height of the hill: though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as the eagle, I will bring thee down from thence, saith Jehovah.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And Edom shall become an astonishment: every one that passeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbor cities thereof, saith Jehovah, no man shall dwell there, neither shall any son of man sojourn therein.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the pride of the Jordan against the strong habitation: for I will suddenly make them run away from it; and whoso is chosen, him will I appoint over it: for who is like me? and who will appoint me a time? and who is the shepherd that will stand before me?</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Therefore hear ye the counsel of Jehovah, that he hath taken against Edom; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the inhabitants of Teman: Surely they shall drag them away, [even] the little ones of the flock; surely he shall make their habitation desolate over them.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> The earth trembleth at the noise of their fall; there is a cry, the noise whereof is heard in the Red Sea.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread out his wings against Bozrah: and the heart of the mighty men of Edom at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Of Damascus. Hamath is confounded, and Arpad; for they have heard evil tidings, they are melted away: there is sorrow on the sea; it cannot be quiet.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Damascus is waxed feeble, she turneth herself to flee, and trembling hath seized on her: anguish and sorrows have taken hold of her, as of a woman in travail.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> How is the city of praise not forsaken, the city of my joy?</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets, and all the men of war shall be brought to silence in that day, saith Jehovah of hosts.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall devour the palaces of Ben-hadad.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Of Kedar, and of the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote. Thus saith Jehovah: Arise ye, go up to Kedar, and destroy the children of the east.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Their tents and their flocks shall they take; they shall carry away for themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels; and they shall cry unto them, Terror on every side!</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Flee ye, wander far off, dwell in the depths, O ye inhabitants of Hazor, saith Jehovah; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath taken counsel against you, and hath conceived a purpose against you.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Arise, get you up unto a nation that is at ease, that dwelleth without care, saith Jehovah; that have neither gates nor bars, that dwell alone.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> And their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their cattle a spoil: and I will scatter unto all winds them that have the corners [of their hair] cut off; and I will bring their calamity from every side of them, saith Jehovah.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> And Hazor shall be a dwelling-place of jackals, a desolation for ever: no man shall dwell there, neither shall any son of man sojourn therein.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> The word of Jehovah that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning Elam, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying,</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Behold, I will break the bow of Elam, the chief of their might.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> And upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven, and will scatter them toward all those winds; and there shall be no nation whither the outcasts of Elam shall not come.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> And I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and before them that seek their life; and I will bring evil upon them, even my fierce anger, saith Jehovah; and I will send the sword after them, till I have consumed them;</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> and I will set my throne in Elam, and will destroy from thence king and princes, saith Jehovah.</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> But it shall come to pass in the latter days, that I will bring back the captivity of Elam, saith Jehovah.</span></div>
