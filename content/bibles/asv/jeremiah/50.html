<div><h4>Jeremiah 50</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The word that Jehovah spake concerning Babylon, concerning the land of the Chaldeans, by Jeremiah the prophet.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Declare ye among the nations and publish, and set up a standard; publish, and conceal not: say, Babylon is taken, Bel is put to shame, Merodach is dismayed; her images are put to shame, her idols are dismayed.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For out of the north there cometh up a nation against her, which shall make her land desolate, and none shall dwell therein: they are fled, they are gone, both man and beast.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> In those days, and in that time, saith Jehovah, the children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together; they shall go on their way weeping, and shall seek Jehovah their God.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> They shall inquire concerning Zion with their faces thitherward, [saying], Come ye, and join yourselves to Jehovah in an everlasting covenant that shall not be forgotten.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> My people have been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused them to go astray; they have turned them away on the mountains; they have gone from mountain to hill; they have forgotten their resting-place.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> All that found them have devoured them; and their adversaries said, We are not guilty, because they have sinned against Jehovah, the habitation of righteousness, even Jehovah, the hope of their fathers.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be as the he-goats before the flocks.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For, lo, I will stir up and cause to come up against Babylon a company of great nations from the north country; and they shall set themselves in array against her; from thence she shall be taken: their arrows shall be as of an expert mighty man; none shall return in vain.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And Chaldea shall be a prey: all that prey upon her shall be satisfied, saith Jehovah.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Because ye are glad, because ye rejoice, O ye that plunder my heritage, because ye are wanton as a heifer that treadeth out [the grain], and neigh as strong horses;</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> your mother shall be utterly put to shame; she that bare you shall be confounded: behold, she shall be the hindermost of the nations, a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Because of the wrath of Jehovah she shall not be inhabited, but she shall be wholly desolate: every one that goeth by Babylon shall be astonished, and hiss at all her plagues.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Set yourselves in array against Babylon round about, all ye that bend the bow; shoot at her, spare no arrows: for she hath sinned against Jehovah.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Shout against her round about: she hath submitted herself; her bulwarks are fallen, her walls are thrown down; for it is the vengeance of Jehovah: take vengeance upon her; as she hath done, do unto her.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest: for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn every one to his people, and they shall flee every one to his own land.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Israel is a hunted sheep; the lions have driven him away: first, the king of Assyria devoured him; and now at last Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath broken his bones.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon and his land, as I have punished the king of Assyria.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> And I will bring Israel again to his pasture, and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be satisfied upon the hills of Ephraim and in Gilead.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> In those days, and in that time, saith Jehovah, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found: for I will pardon them whom I leave as a remnant.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Go up against the land of Merathaim, even against it, and against the inhabitants of Pekod: slay and utterly destroy after them, saith Jehovah, and do according to all that I have commanded thee.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> A sound of battle is in the land, and of great destruction.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> How is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations!</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> I have laid a snare for thee, and thou art also taken, O Babylon, and thou wast not aware: thou art found, and also caught, because thou hast striven against Jehovah.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Jehovah hath opened his armory, and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation; for the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, hath a work [to do] in the land of the Chaldeans.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Come against her from the utmost border; open her store-houses; cast her up as heaps, and destroy her utterly; let nothing of her be left.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Slay all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter: woe unto them! for their day is come, the time of their visitation.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> The voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of Jehovah our God, the vengeance of his temple.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Call together the archers against Babylon, all them that bend the bow; encamp against her round about; let none thereof escape: recompense her according to her work; according to all that she hath done, do unto her; for she hath been proud against Jehovah, against the Holy One of Israel.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Therefore shall her young men fall in her streets, and all her men of war shall be brought to silence in that day, saith Jehovah.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Behold, I am against thee, O thou proud one, saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts; for thy day is come, the time that I will visit thee.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> And the proud one shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise him up; and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour all that are round about him.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: The children of Israel and the children of Judah are oppressed together; and all that took them captive hold them fast; they refuse to let them go.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> Their Redeemer is strong; Jehovah of hosts is his name: he will thoroughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to the earth, and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> A sword is upon the Chaldeans, saith Jehovah, and upon the inhabitants of Babylon, and upon her princes, and upon her wise men.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> A sword is upon the boasters, and they shall become fools; a sword is upon her mighty men, and they shall be dismayed.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> A sword is upon their horses, and upon their chariots, and upon all the mingled people that are in the midst of her; and they shall become as women: a sword is upon her treasures, and they shall be robbed.</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> A drought is upon her waters, and they shall be dried up; for it is a land of graven images, and they are mad over idols.</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> Therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wolves shall dwell there, and the ostriches shall dwell therein: and it shall be no more inhabited for ever; neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation.</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> As when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbor cities thereof, saith Jehovah, so shall no man dwell there, neither shall any son of man sojourn therein.</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> Behold, a people cometh from the north; and a great nation and many kings shall be stirred up from the uttermost parts of the earth.</span><span class="42"> <sup>42</sup> They lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roareth like the sea; and they ride upon horses, every one set in array, as a man to the battle, against thee, O daughter of Babylon.</span><span class="43"> <sup>43</sup> The king of Babylon hath heard the tidings of them, and his hands wax feeble: anguish hath taken hold of him, [and] pangs as of a woman in travail.</span><span class="44"> <sup>44</sup> Behold, [the enemy] shall come up like a lion from the pride of the Jordan against the strong habitation: for I will suddenly make them run away from it; and whoso is chosen, him will I appoint over it: for who is like me? and who will appoint me a time? and who is the shepherd that can stand before me?</span><span class="45"> <sup>45</sup> Therefore hear ye the counsel of Jehovah, that he hath taken against Babylon; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely they shall drag them away, [even] the little ones of the flock; surely he shall make their habitation desolate over them.</span><span class="46"> <sup>46</sup> At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth trembleth, and the cry is heard among the nations.</span></div>
