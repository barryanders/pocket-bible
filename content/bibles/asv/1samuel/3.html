<div><h4>1 Samuel 3</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And the child Samuel ministered unto Jehovah before Eli. And the word of Jehovah was precious in those days; there was no frequent vision.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place (now his eyes had begun to wax dim, so that he could not see),</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> and the lamp of God was not yet gone out, and Samuel was laid down [to sleep], in the temple of Jehovah, where the ark of God was;</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> that Jehovah called Samuel; and he said, Here am I.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And Jehovah called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Now Samuel did not yet know Jehovah, neither was the word of Jehovah yet revealed unto him.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And Jehovah called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And Eli perceived that Jehovah had called the child.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, Jehovah; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And Jehovah came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel said, Speak; for thy servant heareth.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And Jehovah said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from the beginning even unto the end.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever, for the iniquity which he knew, because his sons did bring a curse upon themselves, and he restrained them not.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be expiated with sacrifice nor offering for ever.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of Jehovah. And Samuel feared to show Eli the vision.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he said, Here am I.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And he said, What is the thing that [Jehovah] hath spoken unto thee? I pray thee, hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide anything from me of all the things that he spake unto thee.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is Jehovah: let him do what seemeth him good.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> And Samuel grew, and Jehovah was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> And all Israel from Dan even to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of Jehovah.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> And Jehovah appeared again in Shiloh; for Jehovah revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of Jehovah.</span></div>
