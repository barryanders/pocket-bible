<div><h4>Habakkuk 3</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet, set to Shigionoth.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> O Jehovah, I have heard the report of thee, and am afraid: O Jehovah, revive thy work in the midst of the years; In the midst of the years make it known; In wrath remember mercy.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> God came from Teman, And the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah. His glory covered the heavens, And the earth was full of his praise.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And [his] brightness was as the light; He had rays [coming forth] from his hand; And there was the hiding of his power.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Before him went the pestilence, And fiery bolts went forth at his feet.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> He stood, and measured the earth; He beheld, and drove asunder the nations; And the eternal mountains were scattered; The everlasting hills did bow; His goings were [as] of old.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction; The curtains of the land of Midian did tremble.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Was Jehovah displeased with the rivers? Was thine anger against the rivers, Or thy wrath against the sea, That thou didst ride upon thy horses, Upon thy chariots of salvation?</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Thy bow was made quite bare; The oaths to the tribes were a [sure] word. Selah. Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> The mountains saw thee, and were afraid; The tempest of waters passed by; The deep uttered its voice, And lifted up its hands on high.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> The sun and moon stood still in their habitation, At the light of thine arrows as they went, At the shining of thy glittering spear.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Thou didst march though the land in indignation; Thou didst thresh the nations in anger.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, For the salvation of thine anointed; Thou woundest the head out of the house of the wicked man, Laying bare the foundation even unto the neck. Selah.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Thou didst pierce with his own staves the head of his warriors: They came as a whirlwind to scatter me; Their rejoicing was as to devour the poor secretly.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Thou didst tread the sea with thy horses, The heap of mighty waters.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> I heard, and my body trembled, My lips quivered at the voice; Rottenness entereth into my bones, and I tremble in my place; Because I must wait quietly for the day of trouble, For the coming up of the people that invadeth us.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> For though the fig-tree shall not flourish, Neither shall fruit be in the vines; The labor of the olive shall fail, And the fields shall yield no food; The flock shall be cut off from the fold, And there shall be no herd in the stalls:</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Yet I will rejoice in Jehovah, I will joy in the God of my salvation.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Jehovah, the Lord, is my strength; And he maketh my feet like hinds' [feet], And will make me to walk upon my high places. </span></div>
