<div><h4>Ecclesiastes 3</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> For everything there is a season, and a time for very purpose under heaven:</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> a time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted;</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> a time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> a time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> a time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> a time to seek, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> a time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> a time to love, and a time to hate; a time for war, and a time for peace.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboreth?</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> I have seen the travail which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised therewith.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> He hath made everything beautiful in its time: also he hath set eternity in their heart, yet so that man cannot find out the work that God hath done from the beginning even to the end.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> I know that there is nothing better for them, than to rejoice, and to do good so long as they live.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy good in all his labor, is the gift of God.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor anything taken from it; and God hath done it, that men should fear before him.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> That which is hath been long ago; and that which is to be hath long ago been: and God seeketh again that which is passed away.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And moreover I saw under the sun, in the place of justice, that wickedness was there; and in the place of righteousness, that wickedness was there.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> I said in my heart, God will judge the righteous and the wicked; for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> I said in my heart, [It is] because of the sons of men, that God may prove them, and that they may see that they themselves are [but as] beasts.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; and man hath no preeminence above the beasts: for all is vanity.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Who knoweth the spirit of man, whether it goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast, whether it goeth downward to the earth?</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Wherefore I saw that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his works; for that is his portion: for who shall bring him [back] to see what shall be after him?</span></div>
