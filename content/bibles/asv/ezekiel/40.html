<div><h4>Ezekiel 40</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth [day] of the month, in the fourteenth year after that the city was smitten, in the selfsame day, the hand of Jehovah was upon me, and he brought me thither.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel, and set me down upon a very high mountain, whereon was as it were the frame of a city on the south.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And he brought me thither; and, behold, there was a man, whose appearance was like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, and set thy heart upon all that I shall show thee; for, to the intent that I may show them unto thee, art thou brought hither: declare all that thou seest to the house of Israel.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And, behold, a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the man's hand a measuring reed six cubits long, of a cubit and a handbreadth each: so he measured the thickness of the building, one reed; and the height, one reed.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east, and went up the steps thereof: and he measured the threshold of the gate, one reed broad; and the other threshold, one reed broad.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And every lodge was one reed long, and one reed broad; and [the space] between the lodges was five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate toward the house was one reed.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> He measured also the porch of the gate toward the house, one reed.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the posts thereof, two cubits; and the porch of the gate was toward the house.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And the lodges of the gate eastward were three on this side, and three on that side; they three were of one measure: and the posts had one measure on this side and on that side.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And he measured the breadth of the opening of the gate, ten cubits; and the length of the gate, thirteen cubits;</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> and a border before the lodges, one cubit [on this side], and a border, one cubit on that side; and the lodges, six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And he measured the gate from the roof of the one lodge to the roof of the other, a breadth of five and twenty cubits; door against door.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> He made also posts, threescore cubits; and the court [reached] unto the posts, round about the gate.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And [from] the forefront of the gate at the entrance unto the forefront of the inner porch of the gate were fifty cubits.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And there were closed windows to the lodges, and to their posts within the gate round about, and likewise to the arches; and windows were round about inward; and upon [each] post were palm-trees.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Then brought he me into the outer court; and, lo, there were chambers and a pavement, made for the court round about: thirty chambers were upon the pavement.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And the pavement was by the side of the gates, answerable unto the length of the gates, even the lower pavement.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate unto the forefront of the inner court without, a hundred cubits, [both] on the east and on the north.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> And the gate of the outer court whose prospect is toward the north, he measured the length thereof and the breadth thereof.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> And the lodges thereof were three on this side and three on that side; and the posts thereof and the arches thereof were after the measure of the first gate: the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> And the windows thereof, and the arches thereof, and the palm-trees thereof, were after the measure of the gate whose prospect is toward the east; and they went up unto it by seven steps; and the arches thereof were before them.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> And there was a gate to the inner court over against the [other] gate, [both] on the north and on the east; and he measured from gate to gate a hundred cubits.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> And he led me toward the south; and, behold, a gate toward the south: and he measured the posts thereof and the arches thereof according to these measures.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> And there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about, like those windows: the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> And there were seven steps to go up to it, and the arches thereof were before them; and it had palm-trees, one on this side, and another on that side, upon the posts thereof.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> And there was a gate to the inner court toward the south: and he measured from gate to gate toward the south a hundred cubits.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Then he brought me to the inner court by the south gate: and he measured the south gate according to these measures;</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> and the lodges thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, according to these measures: and there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about; it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> And there were arches round about, five and twenty cubits long, and five cubits broad.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> And the arches thereof were toward the outer court; and palm-trees were upon the posts thereof: and the ascent to it had eight steps.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> And he brought me into the inner court toward the east: and he measured the gate according to these measures;</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> and the lodges thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, according to these measures: and there were windows therein and in the arches thereof round about; it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> And the arches thereof were toward the outer court; and palm-trees were upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the ascent to it had eight steps.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> And he brought me to the north gate: and he measured [it] according to these measures;</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> the lodges thereof, the posts thereof, and the arches thereof: and there were windows therein round about; the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> And the posts thereof were toward the outer court; and palm-trees were upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the ascent to it had eight steps.</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> And a chamber with the door thereof was by the posts at the gates; there they washed the burnt-offering.</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, to slay thereon the burnt-offering and the sin-offering and the trespass-offering.</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> And on the [one] side without, as one goeth up to the entry of the gate toward the north, were two tables; and on the other side, which belonged to the porch of the gate, were two tables.</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate; eight tables, whereupon they slew [the sacrifices].</span><span class="42"> <sup>42</sup> And there were four tables for the burnt-offering, of hewn stone, a cubit and a half long, and a cubit and a half broad, and one cubit high; whereupon they laid the instruments wherewith they slew the burnt-offering and the sacrifice.</span><span class="43"> <sup>43</sup> And the hooks, a handbreadth long, were fastened within round about: and upon the tables was the flesh of the oblation.</span><span class="44"> <sup>44</sup> And without the inner gate were chambers for the singers in the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate; and their prospect was toward the south; one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north.</span><span class="45"> <sup>45</sup> And he said unto me, This chamber, whose prospect is toward the south, is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house;</span><span class="46"> <sup>46</sup> and the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar: these are the sons of Zadok, who from among the sons of Levi come near to Jehovah to minister unto him.</span><span class="47"> <sup>47</sup> And he measured the court, a hundred cubits long, and a hundred cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar was before the house.</span><span class="48"> <sup>48</sup> Then he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side: and the breadth of the gate was three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side.</span><span class="49"> <sup>49</sup> The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits; even by the steps whereby they went up to it: and there were pillars by the posts, one on this side, and another on that side.</span></div>
