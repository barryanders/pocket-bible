<div><h4>Ezekiel 29</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> In the tenth year, in the tenth [month], in the twelfth [day] of the month, the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Son of man, set thy face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him, and against all Egypt;</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> speak, and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against thee, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great monster that lieth in the midst of his rivers, that hath said, My river is mine own, and I have made it for myself.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And I will put hooks in thy jaws, and I will cause the fish of thy rivers to stick unto thy scales; and I will bring thee up out of the midst of thy rivers, with all the fish of thy rivers which stick unto thy scales.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And I will cast thee forth into the wilderness, thee and all the fish of thy rivers: thou shalt fall upon the open field; thou shalt not be brought together, nor gathered; I have given thee for food to the beasts of the earth and to the birds of the heavens.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am Jehovah, because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> When they took hold of thee by thy hand, thou didst break, and didst rend all their shoulders; and when they leaned upon thee, thou brakest, and madest all their loins to be at a stand.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will bring a sword upon thee, and will cut off from thee man and beast.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And the land of Egypt shall be a desolation and a waste; and they shall know that I am Jehovah. Because he hath said, The river is mine, and I have made it;</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> therefore, behold, I am against thee, and against thy rivers, and I will make the land of Egypt an utter waste and desolation, from the tower of Seveneh even unto the border of Ethiopia.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of beast shall pass through it, neither shall it be inhabited forty years.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And I will make the land of Egypt a desolation in the midst of the countries that are desolate; and her cities among the cities that are laid waste shall be a desolation forty years; and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: At the end of forty years will I gather the Egyptians from the peoples whither they were scattered;</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> and I will bring back the captivity of Egypt, and will cause them to return into the land of Pathros, into the land of their birth; and they shall be there a base kingdom.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> It shall be the basest of the kingdoms; neither shall it any more lift itself up above the nations: and I will diminish them, that they shall no more rule over the nations.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And it shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel, bringing iniquity to remembrance, when they turn to look after them: and they shall know that I am the Lord Jehovah.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, in the first [month], in the first [day] of the month, the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Son of man, Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyre: every head was made bald, and every shoulder was worn; yet had he no wages, nor his army, from Tyre, for the service that he had served against it.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will give the land of Egypt unto Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall carry off her multitude, and take her spoil, and take her prey; and it shall be the wages for his army.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> I have given him the land of Egypt as his recompense for which he served, because they wrought for me, saith the Lord Jehovah.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> In that day will I cause a horn to bud forth unto the house of Israel, and I will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midst of them; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.</span></div>
