<div><h4>Ezekiel 7</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Moreover the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And thou, son of man, thus saith the Lord Jehovah unto the land of Israel, An end: the end is come upon the four corners of the land.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Now is the end upon thee, and I will send mine anger upon thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways; and I will bring upon thee all thine abominations.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And mine eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity; but I will bring thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee: and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: An evil, an only evil; behold, it cometh.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> An end is come, the end is come; it awaketh against thee; behold, it cometh.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Thy doom is come unto thee, O inhabitant of the land: the time is come, the day is near, [a day of] tumult, and not [of] joyful shouting, upon the mountains.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Now will I shortly pour out my wrath upon thee, and accomplish mine anger against thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways; and I will bring upon thee all thine abominations.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: I will bring upon thee according to thy ways; and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I, Jehovah, do smite.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Behold, the day, behold, it cometh: thy doom is gone forth; the rod hath blossomed, pride hath budded.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness; none of them [shall remain], nor of their multitude, nor of their wealth: neither shall there be eminency among them.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn; for wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although they be yet alive: for the vision is touching the whole multitude thereof, none shall return; neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> They have blown the trumpet, and have made all ready; but none goeth to the battle; for my wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> The sword is without, and the pestilence and the famine within: he that is in the field shall die with the sword: and he that is in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour him.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> But those of them that escape shall escape, and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them moaning, every one in his iniquity.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak as water.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> They shall also gird themselves with sackcloth, and horror shall cover them; and shame shall be upon all faces, and baldness upon all their heads.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be as an unclean thing; their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of Jehovah: they shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their bowels; because it hath been the stumblingblock of their iniquity.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty; but they made the images of their abominations [and] their detestable things therein: therefore have I made it unto them as an unclean thing.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall profane it.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> My face will I turn also from them, and they shall profane my secret [place]; and robbers shall enter into it, and profane it.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Make the chain; for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Wherefore I will bring the worst of the nations, and they shall possess their houses: I will also make the pride of the strong to cease; and their holy places shall be profaned.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Destruction cometh; and they shall seek peace, and there shall be none.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumor shall be upon rumor; and they shall seek a vision of the prophet; but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the elders.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled: I will do unto them after their way, and according to their deserts will I judge them; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.</span></div>
