<div><h4>Psalms 101</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> A Psalm of David. I will sing of lovingkindness and justice: Unto thee, O Jehovah, will I sing praises.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way: Oh when wilt thou come unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> I will set no base thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside; It shall not cleave unto me.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> A perverse heart shall depart from me: I will know no evil thing.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Whoso privily slandereth his neighbor, him will I destroy: Him that hath a high look and a proud heart will I not suffer.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me: He that walketh in a perfect way, he shall minister unto me.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house: He that speaketh falsehood shall not be established before mine eyes.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Morning by morning will I destroy all the wicked of the land; To cut off all the workers of iniquity from the city of Jehovah.</span></div>
