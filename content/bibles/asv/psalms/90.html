<div><h4>Psalms 90</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> A Prayer of Moses the man of God. Lord, thou hast been our dwelling-place In all generations.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Before the mountains were brought forth, Or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, Even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Thou turnest man to destruction, And sayest, Return, ye children of men.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For a thousand years in thy sight Are but as yesterday when it is past, And as a watch in the night.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep: In the morning they are like grass which groweth up.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; In the evening it is cut down, and withereth.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For we are consumed in thine anger, And in thy wrath are we troubled.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, Our secret sins in the light of thy countenance.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: We bring our years to an end as a sigh.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> The days of our years are threescore years and ten, Or even by reason of strength fourscore years; Yet is their pride but labor and sorrow; For it is soon gone, and we fly away.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Who knoweth the power of thine anger, And thy wrath according to the fear that is due unto thee?</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> So teach us to number our days, That we may get us a heart of wisdom.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Return, O Jehovah; how long? And let it repent thee concerning thy servants.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Oh satisfy us in the morning with thy lovingkindness, That we may rejoice and be glad all our days.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted us, And the years wherein we have seen evil.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Let thy work appear unto thy servants, And thy glory upon their children.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And let the favor of the Lord our God be upon us; And establish thou the work of our hands upon us; Yea, the work of our hands establish thou it.</span></div>
