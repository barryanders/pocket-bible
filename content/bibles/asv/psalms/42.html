<div><h4>Psalms 42</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician. Maschil of the sons of Korah. As the hart panteth after the water brooks, So panteth my soul after thee, O God.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: When shall I come and appear before God?</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> My tears have been my food day and night, While they continually say unto me, Where is thy God?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> These things I remember, and pour out my soul within me, How I went with the throng, and led them to the house of God, With the voice of joy and praise, a multitude keeping holyday.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Why art thou cast down, O my soul? And [why] art thou disquieted within me? Hope thou in God; for I shall yet praise him [For] the help of his countenance.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> O my God, my soul is cast down within me: Therefore do I remember thee from the land of the Jordan, And the Hermons, from the hill Mizar.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterfalls: All thy waves and thy billows are gone over me.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> [Yet] Jehovah will command his lovingkindness in the day-time; And in the night his song shall be with me, [Even] a prayer unto the God of my life.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> I will say unto God my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me? Why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> As with a sword in my bones, mine adversaries reproach me, While they continually say unto me, Where is thy God?</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Why art thou cast down, O my soul? And why art thou disquieted within me? Hope thou in God; for I shall yet praise him, [Who is] the help of my countenance, and my God.</span></div>
