<div><h4>Psalms 141</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> A Psalm of David. Jehovah, I have called upon thee; make haste unto me: Give ear unto my voice, when I call unto thee.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Let my prayer be set forth as incense before thee; The lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Set a watch, O Jehovah, before my mouth; Keep the door of my lips.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Incline not my heart to any evil thing, To practise deeds of wickedness With men that work iniquity: And let me not eat of their dainties.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Let the righteous smite me, [it shall be] a kindness; And let him reprove me, [it shall be as] oil upon the head; Let not my head refuse it: For even in their wickedness shall my prayer continue.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Their judges are thrown down by the sides of the rock; And they shall hear my words; for they are sweet.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> As when one ploweth and cleaveth the earth, Our bones are scattered at the mouth of Sheol.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> For mine eyes are unto thee, O Jehovah the Lord: In thee do I take refuge; leave not my soul destitute.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Keep me from the snare which they have laid for me, And from the gins of the workers of iniquity.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Let the wicked fall into their own nets, Whilst that I withal escape.</span></div>
