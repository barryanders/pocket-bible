<div><h4>Psalms 62</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician; after the manner of Jeduthan. A Psalm of David. My soul waiteth in silence for God only: From him [cometh] my salvation.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> He only is my rock and my salvation: [He is] my high tower; I shall not be greatly moved.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> How long will ye set upon a man, That ye may slay [him], all of you, Like a leaning wall, like a tottering fence?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> They only consult to thrust him down from his dignity; They delight in lies; They bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. Selah</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> My soul, wait thou in silence for God only; For my expectation is from him.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> He only is my rock and my salvation: [He is] my high tower; I shall not be moved.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> With God is my salvation and my glory: The rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Trust in him at all times, ye people; Pour out your heart before him: God is a refuge for us. Selah</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie: In the balances they will go up; They are together lighter than vanity.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Trust not in oppression, And become not vain in robbery: If riches increase, set not your heart [thereon].</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> God hath spoken once, Twice have I heard this, That power belongeth unto God.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth lovingkindness; For thou renderest to every man according to his work.</span></div>
