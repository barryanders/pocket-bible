<div><h4>Psalms 123</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> A Song of Ascents. Unto thee do I lift up mine eyes, O thou that sittest in the heavens.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Behold, as the eyes of servants [look] unto the hand of their master, As the eyes of a maid unto the hand of her mistress; So our eyes [look] unto Jehovah our God, Until he have mercy upon us.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Have mercy upon us, O Jehovah, have mercy upon us; For we are exceedingly filled with contempt.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Our soul is exceedingly filled With the scoffing of those that are at ease, And with the contempt of the proud.</span></div>
