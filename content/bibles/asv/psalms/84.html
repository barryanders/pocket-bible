<div><h4>Psalms 84</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician; set to the Gittith. A Psalm of the sons of Korah. How amiable are thy tabernacles, O Jehovah of hosts!</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of Jehovah; My heart and my flesh cry out unto the living God.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Yea, the sparrow hath found her a house, And the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, Even thine altars, O Jehovah of hosts, My King, and my God.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: They will be still praising thee. Selah</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; In whose heart are the highways [to Zion].</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Passing through the valley of Weeping they make it a place of springs; Yea, the early rain covereth it with blessings.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> They go from strength to strength; Every one of them appeareth before God in Zion.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> O Jehovah God of hosts, hear my prayer; Give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Behold, O God our shield, And look upon the face of thine anointed.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, Than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For Jehovah God is a sun and a shield: Jehovah will give grace and glory; No good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> O Jehovah of hosts, Blessed is the man that trusteth in thee.</span></div>
