<div><h4>Psalms 10</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Why standest thou afar off, O Jehovah? Why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble?</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> In the pride of the wicked the poor is hotly pursued; Let them be taken in the devices that they have conceived.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, And the covetous renounceth, [yea], contemneth Jehovah.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> The wicked, in the pride of his countenance, [saith], He will not require [it]. All his thoughts are, There is no God.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> His ways are firm at all times; Thy judgments are far above out of his sight: As for all his adversaries, he puffeth at them.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> He saith in his heart, I shall not be moved; To all generations I shall not be in adversity.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and oppression: Under his tongue is mischief and iniquity.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> He sitteth in the lurking-places of the villages; In the secret places doth he murder the innocent; His eyes are privily set against the helpless.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> He lurketh in secret as a lion in his covert; He lieth in wait to catch the poor: He doth catch the poor, when he draweth him in his net.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> He croucheth, he boweth down, And the helpless fall by his strong ones.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> He saith in his heart, God hath forgotten; He hideth his face; he will never see it.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Arise, O Jehovah; O God, lift up thy hand: Forget not the poor.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God, And say in his heart, Thou wilt not require [it]?</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Thou hast seen [it]; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to requite it with thy hand: The helpless committeth [himself] unto thee; Thou hast been the helper of the fatherless.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Break thou the arm of the wicked; And as for the evil man, seek out his wickedness till thou find none.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Jehovah is King for ever and ever: The nations are perished out of his land.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Jehovah, thou hast heard the desire of the meek: Thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear;</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, That man who is of the earth may be terrible no more.</span></div>
