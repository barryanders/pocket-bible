<div><h4>Psalms 133</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> A Song of Ascents; of David. Behold, how good and how pleasant it is For brethren to dwell together in unity!</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> It is like the precious oil upon the head, That ran down upon the beard, Even Aaron's beard; That came down upon the skirt of his garments;</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Like the dew of Hermon, That cometh down upon the mountains of Zion: For there Jehovah commanded the blessing, Even life for evermore.</span></div>
