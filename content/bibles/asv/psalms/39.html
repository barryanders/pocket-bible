<div><h4>Psalms 39</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician, Jeduthun. A Psalm of David. I said, I will take heed to my ways, That I sin not with my tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle, While the wicked is before me.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, even from good; And my sorrow was stirred.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> My heart was hot within me; While I was musing the fire burned: [Then] spake I with my tongue:</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Jehovah, make me to know mine end, And the measure of my days, what it is; Let me know how frail I am.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Behold, thou hast made my days [as] handbreadths; And my life-time is as nothing before thee: Surely every man at his best estate is altogether vanity. Selah</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Surely every man walketh in a vain show; Surely they are disquieted in vain: He heapeth up [riches], and knoweth not who shall gather them.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And now, Lord, what wait I for? My hope is in thee.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Deliver me from all my transgressions: Make me not the reproach of the foolish.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; Because thou didst it.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Remove thy stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of thy hand.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, Thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth: Surely every man is vanity. Selah</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Hear my prayer, O Jehovah, and give ear unto my cry; Hold not thy peace at my tears: For I am a stranger with thee, A sojourner, as all my fathers were.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Oh spare me, that I may recover strength, Before I go hence, and be no more.</span></div>
