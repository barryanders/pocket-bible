<div><h4>Psalms 60</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician; [set to] Shushan Eduth. Michtam of David, to teach; and when he strove with Aram-naharaim and with Aram-zobah, and Joab returned, and smote of Edom in the Valley of Salt twelve thousand. O God thou hast cast us off, thou hast broken us down; Thou hast been angry; oh restore us again.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Thou hast made the land to tremble; thou hast rent it: Heal the breaches thereof; for it shaketh.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Thou hast showed thy people hard things: Thou hast made us to drink the wine of staggering.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, That it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> That thy beloved may be delivered, Save with thy right hand, and answer us.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> God hath spoken in his holiness: I will exult; I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the defence of my head; Judah is my sceptre.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Moab is my washpot; Upon Edom will I cast my shoe: Philistia, shout thou because of me.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Who will bring me into the strong city? Who hath led me unto Edom?</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Hast not thou, O God, cast us off? And thou goest not forth, O God, with our hosts.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Give us help against the adversary; For vain is the help of man.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Through God we shall do valiantly; For he it is that will tread down our adversaries.</span></div>
