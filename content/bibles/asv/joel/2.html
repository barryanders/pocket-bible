<div><h4>Joel 2</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy mountain; let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the day of Jehovah cometh, for it is nigh at hand;</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness, as the dawn spread upon the mountains; a great people and a strong; there hath not been ever the like, neither shall be any more after them, even to the years of many generations.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> A fire devoureth before them; and behind them a flame burneth: the land is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness; yea, and none hath escaped them.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses; and as horsemen, so do they run.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Like the noise of chariots on the tops of the mountains do they leap, like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble, as a strong people set in battle array.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> At their presence the peoples are in anguish; all faces are waxed pale.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> They run like mighty men; they climb the wall like men of war; and they march every one on his ways, and they break not their ranks.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Neither doth one thrust another; they march every one in his path; and they burst through the weapons, and break not off [their course].</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> They leap upon the city; they run upon the wall; they climb up into the houses; they enter in at the windows like a thief.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> The earth quaketh before them; the heavens tremble; the sun and the moon are darkened, and the stars withdraw their shining.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And Jehovah uttereth his voice before his army; for his camp is very great; for he is strong that executeth his word; for the day of Jehovah is great and very terrible; and who can abide it?</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Yet even now, saith Jehovah, turn ye unto me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning:</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> and rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto Jehovah your God; for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness, and repenteth him of the evil.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Who knoweth whether he will not turn and repent, and leave a blessing behind him, even a meal-offering and a drink-offering unto Jehovah your God?</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly;</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> gather the people, sanctify the assembly, assemble the old men, gather the children, and those that suck the breasts; let the bridegroom go forth from his chamber, and the bride out of her closet.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Let the priests, the ministers of Jehovah, weep between the porch and the altar, and let them say, Spare thy people, O Jehovah, and give not thy heritage to reproach, that the nations should rule over them: wherefore should they say among the peoples, Where is their God?</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Then was Jehovah jealous for his land, and had pity on his people.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> And Jehovah answered and said unto his people, Behold, I will send you grain, and new wine, and oil, and ye shall be satisfied therewith; and I will no more make you a reproach among the nations;</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> but I will remove far off from you the northern [army], and will drive it into a land barren and desolate, its forepart into the eastern sea, and its hinder part into the western sea; and its stench shall come up, and its ill savor shall come up, because it hath done great things.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Fear not, O land, be glad and rejoice; for Jehovah hath done great things.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field; for the pastures of the wilderness do spring, for the tree beareth its fruit, the fig-tree and the vine do yield their strength.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in Jehovah your God; for he giveth you the former rain in just measure, and he causeth to come down for you the rain, the former rain and the latter rain, in the first [month].</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the vats shall overflow with new wine and oil.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the canker-worm, and the caterpillar, and the palmer-worm, my great army which I sent among you.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> And ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied, and shall praise the name of Jehovah your God, that hath dealt wondrously with you; and my people shall never be put to shame.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am Jehovah your God, and there is none else; and my people shall never be put to shame.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions:</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my Spirit.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> And I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth: blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of Jehovah cometh.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of Jehovah shall be delivered; for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem there shall be those that escape, as Jehovah hath said, and among the remnant those whom Jehovah doth call.</span></div>
