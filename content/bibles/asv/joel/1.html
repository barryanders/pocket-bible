<div><h4>Joel 1</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The word of Jehovah that came to Joel the son of Pethuel.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Hear this, ye old men, and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the land. Hath this been in your days, or in the days of your fathers?</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Tell ye your children of it, and [let] your children [tell] their children, and their children another generation.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> That which the palmer-worm hath left hath the locust eaten; and that which the locust hath left hath the canker-worm eaten; and that which the canker-worm hath left hath the caterpillar eaten.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Awake, ye drunkards, and weep; and wail, all ye drinkers of wine, because of the sweet wine; for it is cut off from your mouth.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For a nation is come up upon my land, strong, and without number; his teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he hath the jaw-teeth of a lioness.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> He hath laid my vine waste, and barked my fig-tree: he hath made it clean bare, and cast it away; the branches thereof are made white.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> The meal-offering and the drink-offering are cut off from the house of Jehovah; the priests, Jehovah's ministers, mourn.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> The field is laid waste, the land mourneth; for the grain is destroyed, the new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Be confounded, O ye husbandmen, wail, O ye vinedressers, for the wheat and for the barley; for the harvest of the field is perished.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> The vine is withered, and the fig-tree languisheth; the pomegranate-tree, the palm-tree also, and the apple-tree, even all the trees of the field are withered: for joy is withered away from the sons of men.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Gird yourselves [with sackcloth], and lament, ye priests; wail, ye ministers of the altar; come, lie all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God: for the meal-offering and the drink-offering are withholden from the house of your God.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the old men [and] all the inhabitants of the land unto the house of Jehovah your God, and cry unto Jehovah.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Alas for the day! for the day of Jehovah is at hand, and as destruction from the Almighty shall it come.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Is not the food cut off before our eyes, [yea], joy and gladness from the house of our God?</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> The seeds rot under their clods; the garners are laid desolate, the barns are broken down; for the grain is withered.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> How do the beasts groan! the herds of cattle are perplexed, because they have no pasture; yea, the flocks of sheep are made desolate.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> O Jehovah, to thee do I cry; for the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and the flame hath burned all the trees of the field.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Yea, the beasts of the field pant unto thee; for the water brooks are dried up, and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness.</span></div>
