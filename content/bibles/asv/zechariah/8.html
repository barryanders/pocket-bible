<div><h4>Zechariah 8</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And the word of Jehovah of hosts came [to me], saying,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: I am jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and I am jealous for her with great wrath.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Thus saith Jehovah: I am returned unto Zion, and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be called The city of truth; and the mountain of Jehovah of hosts, The holy mountain.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: There shall yet old men and old women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, every man with his staff in his hand for very age.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets thereof.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: If it be marvellous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in those days, should it also be marvellous in mine eyes? saith Jehovah of hosts.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Behold, I will save my people from the east country, and from the west country;</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> and I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem; and they shall be my people, and I will be their God, in truth and in righteousness.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Let your hands be strong, ye that hear in these days these words from the mouth of the prophets that were in the day that the foundation of the house of Jehovah of hosts was laid, even the temple, that it might be built.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For before those days there was no hire for man, nor any hire for beast; neither was there any peace to him that went out or came in, because of the adversary: for I set all men every one against his neighbor.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> But now I will not be unto the remnant of this people as in the former days, saith Jehovah of hosts.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> For [there shall be] the seed of peace; the vine shall give its fruit, and the ground shall give its increase, and the heavens shall give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to inherit all these things.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And it shall come to pass that, as ye were a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so will I save you, and ye shall be a blessing.
