<div><h4>Zechariah 6</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And again I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the mountains were mountains of brass.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> In the first chariot were red horses; and in the second chariot black horses;</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> and in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot grizzled strong horses.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Then I answered and said unto the angel that talked with me, What are these, my lord?</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And the angel answered and said unto me, These are the four winds of heaven, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> [The chariot] wherein are the black horses goeth forth toward the north country; and the white went forth after them; and the grizzled went forth toward the south country.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And the strong went forth, and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth: and he said, Get you hence, walk to and fro through the earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Then cried he to me, and spake unto me, saying, Behold, they that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Take of them of the captivity, even of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah; and come thou the same day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, whither they are come from Babylon;</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> yea, take [of them] silver and gold, and make crowns, and set them upon the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest;</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> and speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh Jehovah of hosts, saying, Behold, the man whose name is the Branch: and he shall grow up out of his place; and he shall build the temple of Jehovah;</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> even he shall build the temple of Jehovah; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne; and he shall be a priest upon his throne; and the counsel of peace shall be between them both.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And the crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the temple of Jehovah.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And they that are far off shall come and build in the temple of Jehovah; and ye shall know that Jehovah of hosts hath sent me unto you. And [this] shall come to pass, if ye will diligently obey the voice of Jehovah your God.</span></div>
