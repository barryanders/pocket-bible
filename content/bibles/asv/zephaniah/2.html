<div><h4>Zephaniah 2</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Gather yourselves together, yea, gather together, O nation that hath no shame;</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> before the decree bring forth, [before] the day pass as the chaff, before the fierce anger of Jehovah come upon you, before the day of Jehovah's anger come upon you.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Seek ye Jehovah, all ye meek of the earth, that have kept his ordinances; seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye will be hid in the day of Jehovah's anger.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For Gaza shall be forsaken, and Ashkelon a desolation; they shall drive out Ashdod at noonday, and Ekron shall be rooted up.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Woe unto the inhabitants of the sea-coast, the nation of the Cherethites! The word of Jehovah is against you, O Canaan, the land of the Philistines; I will destroy thee, that there shall be no inhabitant.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And the sea-coast shall be pastures, with cottages for shepherds and folds for flocks.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah; they shall feed [their flocks] thereupon; in the houses of Ashkelon shall they lie down in the evening; for Jehovah their God will visit them, and bring back their captivity.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the children of Ammon, wherewith they have reproached my people, and magnified themselves against their border.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Therefore as I live, saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, Surely Moab shall be as Sodom, and the children of Ammon as Gomorrah, a possession of nettles, and saltpits, and a perpetual desolation: the residue of my people shall make a prey of them, and the remnant of my nation shall inherit them.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> This shall they have for their pride, because they have reproached and magnified themselves against the people of Jehovah of hosts.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Jehovah will be terrible unto them; for he will famish all the gods of the earth; and men shall worship him, every one from his place, even all the isles of the nations.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Ye Ethiopians also, ye shall be slain by my sword.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And he will stretch out his hand against the north, and destroy Assyria, and will make Nineveh a desolation, and dry like the wilderness.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And herds shall lie down in the midst of her, all the beasts of the nations: both the pelican and the porcupine shall lodge in the capitals thereof; [their] voice shall sing in the windows; desolation shall be in the thresholds: for he hath laid bare the cedar-work.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> This is the joyous city that dwelt carelessly, that said in her heart, I am, and there is none besides me: how is she become a desolation, a place for beasts to lie down in! every one that passeth by her shall hiss, and wag his hand.</span></div>
