<div><h4>1 Corinthians 10</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> For I would not, brethren, have you ignorant, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> and were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea;</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> and did all eat the same spiritual food;</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> and did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of a spiritual rock that followed them: and the rock was Christ.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Howbeit with most of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Neither let us make trial of the Lord, as some of them made trial, and perished by the serpents.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Neither murmur ye, as some of them murmured, and perished by the destroyer.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Now these things happened unto them by way of example; and they were written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the ages are come.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> There hath no temptation taken you but such as man can bear: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation make also the way of escape, that ye may be able to endure it.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Wherefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not a communion of the body of Christ?</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> seeing that we, who are many, are one bread, one body: for we are all partake of the one bread.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Behold Israel after the flesh: have not they that eat the sacrifices communion with the altar?</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> What say I then? that a thing sacrificed to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything?</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> But [I say], that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have communion with demons.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of demons: ye cannot partake of the table of the Lord, and of the table of demons.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> All things are lawful; but not all things are expedient. All things are lawful; but not all things edify.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Let no man seek his own, but [each] his neighbor's [good].</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, eat, asking no question for conscience' sake,</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> for the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> If one of them that believe not biddeth you [to a feast], and ye are disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience' sake.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> But if any man say unto you, This hath been offered in sacrifice, eat not, for his sake that showed it, and for conscience sake:</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> conscience, I say, not thine own, but the other's; for why is my liberty judged by another conscience?</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> If I partake with thankfulness, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> Give no occasions of stumbling, either to Jews, or to Greeks, or to the church of God:</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> even as I also please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the [profit] of the many, that they may be saved.</span></div>
