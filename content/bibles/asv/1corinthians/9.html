<div><h4>1 Corinthians 9</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are not ye my work in the Lord?</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> If to others I am not an apostle, yet at least I am to you; for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> My defence to them that examine me is this.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Have we no right to eat and to drink?</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Have we no right to lead about a wife that is a believer, even as the rest of the apostles, and the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Or I only and Barnabas, have we not a right to forbear working?</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> What soldier ever serveth at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not the fruit thereof? Or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Do I speak these things after the manner of men? or saith not the law also the same?</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn. Is it for the oxen that God careth,</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> or saith he it assuredly for our sake? Yea, for our sake it was written: because he that ploweth ought to plow in hope, and he that thresheth, [to thresh] in hope of partaking.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> If we sowed unto you spiritual things, is it a great matter if we shall reap your carnal things?</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> If others partake of [this] right over you, do not we yet more? Nevertheless we did not use this right; but we bear all things, that we may cause no hindrance to the gospel of Christ.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Know ye not that they that minister about sacred things eat [of] the things of the temple, [and] they that wait upon the altar have their portion with the altar?</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Even so did the Lord ordain that they that proclaim the gospel should live of the gospel.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> But I have used none of these things: and I write not these things that it may be so done in my case; for [it were] good for me rather to die, than that any man should make my glorifying void.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> For if I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of; for necessity is laid upon me; for woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> For if I do this of mine own will, I have a reward: but if not of mine own will, I have a stewardship intrusted to me.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> What then is my reward? That, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel without charge, so as not to use to the full my right in the gospel.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> For though I was free from all [men,] I brought myself under bondage to all, that I might gain the more.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> And to the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, not being myself under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> to them that are without law, as without law, not being without law to God, but under law to Christ, that I might gain them that are without law.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> To the weak I became weak, that I might gain the weak: I am become all things to all men, that I may by all means save some.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> And I do all things for the gospel's sake, that I may be a joint partaker thereof.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Know ye not that they that run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? Even so run; that ye may attain.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> And every man that striveth in the games exerciseth self-control in all things. Now they [do it] to receive a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> I therefore so run, as not uncertainly; so fight I, as not beating the air:</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> but I buffet my body, and bring it into bondage: lest by any means, after that I have preached to others, I myself should be rejected.</span></div>
