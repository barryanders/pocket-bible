<div><h4>1 Peter 3</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> In like manner, ye wives, [be] in subjection to your won husbands; that, even if any obey not the word, they may without the word be gained by the behavior of their wives;</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> beholding your chaste behavior [coupled] with fear.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Whose [adorning] let it not be the outward adorning of braiding the hair, and of wearing jewels of gold, or of putting on apparel;</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> but [let it be] the hidden man of the heart, in the incorruptible [apparel] of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For after this manner aforetime the holy women also, who hoped in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection to their own husbands:</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose children ye now are, if ye do well, and are not put in fear by any terror.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Ye husbands, in like manner, dwell with [your wives] according to knowledge, giving honor unto the woman, as unto the weaker vessel, as being also joint-heirs of the grace of life; to the end that your prayers be not hindered.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Finally, [be] ye all likeminded, compassionate, loving as brethren, tenderhearted, humbleminded:</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> not rendering evil for evil, or reviling for reviling; but contrariwise blessing; for hereunto were ye called, that ye should inherit a blessing.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For, He that would love life, And see good days, Let him refrain his tongue from evil, And his lips that they speak no guile:</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And let him turn away from evil, and do good; Let him seek peace, and pursue it.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> For the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, And his ears unto their supplication: But the face of the Lord is upon them that do evil.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And who is he that will harm you, if ye be zealous of that which is good?</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> But even if ye should suffer for righteousness' sake, blessed [are ye:] and fear not their fear, neither be troubled;</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> but sanctify in your hearts Christ as Lord: [being] ready always to give answer to every man that asketh you a reason concerning the hope that is in you, yet with meekness and fear:</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> having a good conscience; that, wherein ye are spoken against, they may be put to shame who revile your good manner of life in Christ.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> For it is better, if the will of God should so will, that ye suffer for well-doing than for evil-doing.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Because Christ also suffered for sins once, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God; being put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit;</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> in which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison,</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> that aforetime were disobedient, when the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water:</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> which also after a true likeness doth now save you, [even] baptism, not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the interrogation of a good conscience toward God, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ;</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> who is one the right hand of God, having gone into heaven; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him.</span></div>
