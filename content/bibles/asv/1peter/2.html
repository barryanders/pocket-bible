<div><h4>1 Peter 2</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Putting away therefore all wickedness, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> as newborn babes, long for the spiritual milk which is without guile, that ye may grow thereby unto salvation;</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> if ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious:</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> unto whom coming, a living stone, rejected indeed of men, but with God elect, precious,</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> ye also, as living stones, are built up a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Because it is contained in scripture, Behold, I lay in Zion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: And he that believeth on him shall not be put to shame.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For you therefore that believe is the preciousness: but for such as disbelieve, The stone which the builders rejected, The same was made the head of the corner;</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> and, A stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence; for they stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> But ye are a elect race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for [God's] own possession, that ye may show forth the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> who in time past were no people, but now are the people of God: who had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Beloved, I beseech you as sojourners and pilgrims, to abstain from fleshly lust, which war against the soul;</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> having your behavior seemly among the Gentiles; that, wherein they speak against you as evil-doers, they may by your good works, which they behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Be subject to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether to the king, as supreme;</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> or unto governors, as sent by him for vengeance on evil-doers and for praise to them that do well.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> For so is the will of God, that by well-doing ye should put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> as free, and not using your freedom for a cloak of wickedness, but as bondservants of God.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Honor all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Servants, [be] in subjection to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> For this is acceptable, if for conscience toward God a man endureth griefs, suffering wrongfully.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> For what glory is it, if, when ye sin, and are buffeted [for it], ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer [for it], ye shall take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> For hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, that ye should follow his steps:</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered threatened not; but committed [himself] to him that judgeth righteously:</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> who his own self bare our sins in his body upon the tree, that we, having died unto sins, might live unto righteousness; by whose stripes ye were healed.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> For ye were going astray like sheep; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.</span></div>
