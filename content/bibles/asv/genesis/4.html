<div><h4>Genesis 4</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And the man knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man with [the help of] Jehovah.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And again she bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto Jehovah.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And Jehovah had respect unto Abel and to his offering:</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And Jehovah said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> If thou doest well, shall it not be lifted up? and if thou doest not well, sin coucheth at the door: and unto thee shall be its desire, but do thou rule over it.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And Cain told Abel his brother. And it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And Jehovah said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: am I my brother's keeper?</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And now cursed art thou from the ground, which hath opened its mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand;</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> when thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee its strength; a fugitive and a wanderer shalt thou be in the earth.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And Cain said unto Jehovah, My punishment is greater than I can bear.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the ground; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth; and it will come to pass, that whosoever findeth me will slay me.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And Jehovah said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And Jehovah appointed a sign for Cain, lest any finding him should smite him.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And Cain went out from the presence of Jehovah, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methushael; and Methushael begat Lamech.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents and [have] cattle.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and pipe.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> And Zillah, she also bare Tubal-cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of brass and iron: and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> And Lamech said unto his wives: Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; Ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: For I have slain a man for wounding me, And a young man for bruising me:</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, Truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth. For, [said she], God hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel; for Cain slew him.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enosh. Then began men to call upon the name of Jehovah.</span></div>
