<div><h4>Amos 5</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Hear ye this word which I take up for a lamentation over you, O house of Israel.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> The virgin of Israel is fallen; she shall no more rise: she is cast down upon her land; there is none to raise her up.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: The city that went forth a thousand shall have a hundred left, and that which went forth a hundred shall have ten left, to the house of Israel.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For thus saith Jehovah unto the house of Israel, Seek ye me, and ye shall live;</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> but seek not Beth-el, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to Beer-sheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Beth-el shall come to nought.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Seek Jehovah, and ye shall live; lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph, and it devour, and there be none to quench it in Beth-el.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Ye who turn justice to wormwood, and cast down righteousness to the earth,</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> [seek him] that maketh the Pleiades and Orion, and turneth the shadow of death into the morning, and maketh the day dark with night; that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth (Jehovah is his name);</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> that bringeth sudden destruction upon the strong, so that destruction cometh upon the fortress.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> They hate him that reproveth in the gate, and they abhor him that speaketh uprightly.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Forasmuch therefore as ye trample upon the poor, and take exactions from him of wheat: ye have built houses of hewn stone, but ye shall not dwell in them; ye have planted pleasant vineyards, but ye shall not drink the wine thereof.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> For I know how manifold are your transgressions, and how mighty are your sins-ye that afflict the just, that take a bribe, and that turn aside the needy in the gate [from their right].</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Therefore he that is prudent shall keep silence in such a time; for it is an evil time.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live; and so Jehovah, the God of hosts, will be with you, as ye say.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish justice in the gate: it may be that Jehovah, the God of hosts, will be gracious unto the remnant of Joseph.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Therefore thus saith Jehovah, the God of hosts, the Lord: Wailing shall be in all the broad ways; and they shall say in all the streets, Alas! Alas! and they shall call the husbandman to mourning, and such as are skilful in lamentation to wailing.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And in all vineyards shall be wailing; for I will pass through the midst of thee, saith Jehovah.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Woe unto you that desire the day of Jehovah! Wherefore would ye have the day of Jehovah? It is darkness, and not light.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Shall not the day of Jehovah be darkness, and not light? even very dark, and no brightness in it?</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> I hate, I despise your feasts, and I will take no delight in your solemn assemblies.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Yea, though ye offer me your burnt-offerings and meal-offerings, I will not accept them; neither will I regard the peace-offerings of your fat beasts.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not hear the melody of thy viols.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> But let justice roll down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Did ye bring unto me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Yea, ye have borne the tabernacle of your king and the shrine of your images, the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus, saith Jehovah, whose name is the God of hosts.</span></div>
