<div><h4>Habakkuk 1</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> O LORD, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear! even cry out unto thee of violence, and thou wilt not save!</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Why dost thou shew me iniquity, and cause me to behold grievance? for spoiling and violence are before me: and there are that raise up strife and contention.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment doth never go forth: for the wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore wrong judgment proceedeth.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Behold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvellously: for I will work a work in your days, which ye will not believe, though it be told you.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess the dwellingplaces that are not theirs.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> They are terrible and dreadful: their judgment and their dignity shall proceed of themselves.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far; they shall fly as the eagle that hasteth to eat.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up as the east wind, and they shall gather the captivity as the sand.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a scorn unto them: they shall deride every strong hold; for they shall heap dust, and take it.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Then shall his mind change, and he shall pass over, and offend, imputing this his power unto his god.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Art thou not from everlasting, O LORD my God, mine Holy One? we shall not die. O LORD, thou hast ordained them for judgment; and, O mighty God, thou hast established them for correction.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, and holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth the man that is more righteous than he?</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, that have no ruler over them?</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> They take up all of them with the angle, they catch them in their net, and gather them in their drag: therefore they rejoice and are glad.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Therefore they sacrifice unto their net, and burn incense unto their drag; because by them their portion is fat, and their meat plenteous.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continually to slay the nations?</span></div>
