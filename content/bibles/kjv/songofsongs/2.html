<div><h4>Song of Songs 2</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> I am the rose of Sharon, and the lily of the valleys.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> As the lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me was love.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples: for I am sick of love.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> His left hand is under my head, and his right hand doth embrace me.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, till he please.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> The voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> My beloved is like a roe or a young hart: behold, he standeth behind our wall, he looketh forth at the windows, shewing himself through the lattice.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone;</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> The flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing of birds is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land;</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> The fig tree putteth forth her green figs, and the vines with the tender grape give a good smell. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines: for our vines have tender grapes.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> My beloved is mine, and I am his: he feedeth among the lilies.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether.</span></div>
