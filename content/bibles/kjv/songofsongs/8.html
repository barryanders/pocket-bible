<div><h4>Song of Songs 8</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> O that thou wert as my brother, that sucked the breasts of my mother! when I should find thee without, I would kiss thee; yea, I should not be despised.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> I would lead thee, and bring thee into my mother's house, who would instruct me: I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> His left hand should be under my head, and his right hand should embrace me.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, until he please.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved? I raised thee up under the apple tree: there thy mother brought thee forth: there she brought thee forth that bare thee.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave: the coals thereof are coals of fire, which hath a most vehement flame.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it: if a man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would utterly be contemned.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts: what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> If she be a wall, we will build upon her a palace of silver: and if she be a door, we will inclose her with boards of cedar.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> I am a wall, and my breasts like towers: then was I in his eyes as one that found favour.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon; he let out the vineyard unto keepers; every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand pieces of silver.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> My vineyard, which is mine, is before me: thou, O Solomon, must have a thousand, and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Thou that dwellest in the gardens, the companions hearken to thy voice: cause me to hear it.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Make haste, my beloved, and be thou like to a roe or to a young hart upon the mountains of spices.</span></div>
