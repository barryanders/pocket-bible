<div><h4>Tobit 4</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> In that day Tobit remembered the money which he had committed to Gabael in Rages of Media,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And said with himself, I have wished for death; wherefore do I not call for my son Tobias that I may signify to him of the money before I die?</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And when he had called him, he said, My son, when I am dead, bury me; and despise not thy mother, but honour her all the days of thy life, and do that which shall please her, and grieve her not.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Remember, my son, that she saw many dangers for thee, when thou wast in her womb: and when she is dead, bury her by me in one grave.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> My son, be mindful of the Lord our God all thy days, and let not thy will be set to sin, or to transgress his commandments: do uprightly all thy life long, and follow not the ways of unrighteousness.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For if thou deal truly, thy doings shall prosperously succeed to thee, and to all them that live justly.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Give alms of thy substance; and when thou givest alms, let not thine eye be envious, neither turn thy face from any poor, and the face of God shall not be turned away from thee.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> If thou hast abundance give alms accordingly: if thou have but a little, be not afraid to give according to that little:</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For thou layest up a good treasure for thyself against the day of necessity.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Because that alms do deliver from death, and suffereth not to come into darkness.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For alms is a good gift unto all that give it in the sight of the most High.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Beware of all whoredom, my son, and chiefly take a wife of the seed of thy fathers, and take not a strange woman to wife, which is not of thy father's tribe: for we are the children of the prophets, Noe, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: remember, my son, that our fathers from the beginning, even that they all married wives of their own kindred, and were blessed in their children, and their seed shall inherit the land.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Now therefore, my son, love thy brethren, and despise not in thy heart thy brethren, the sons and daughters of thy people, in not taking a wife of them: for in pride is destruction and much trouble, and in lewdness is decay and great want: for lewdness is the mother of famine.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Let not the wages of any man, which hath wrought for thee, tarry with thee, but give him it out of hand: for if thou serve God, he will also repay thee: be circumspect my son, in all things thou doest, and be wise in all thy conversation.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Do that to no man which thou hatest: drink not wine to make thee drunken: neither let drunkenness go with thee in thy journey.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Give of thy bread to the hungry, and of thy garments to them that are naked; and according to thine abundance give alms: and let not thine eye be envious, when thou givest alms.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Pour out thy bread on the burial of the just, but give nothing to the wicked.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Ask counsel of all that are wise, and despise not any counsel that is profitable.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Bless the Lord thy God alway, and desire of him that thy ways may be directed, and that all thy paths and counsels may prosper: for every nation hath not counsel; but the Lord himself giveth all good things, and he humbleth whom he will, as he will; now therefore, my son, remember my commandments, neither let them be put out of thy mind.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> And now I signify this to they that I committed ten talents to Gabael the son of Gabrias at Rages in Media.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> And fear not, my son, that we are made poor: for thou hast much wealth, if thou fear God, and depart from all sin, and do that which is pleasing in his sight.</span></div>
