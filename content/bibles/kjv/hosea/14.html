<div><h4>Hosea 14</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> O Israel, return unto the LORD thy God; for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Take with you words, and turn to the LORD: say unto him, Take away all iniquity, and receive us graciously: so will we render the calves of our lips.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Asshur shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses: neither will we say any more to the work of our hands, Ye are our gods: for in thee the fatherless findeth mercy.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely: for mine anger is turned away from him.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> I will be as the dew unto Israel: he shall grow as the lily, and cast forth his roots as Lebanon.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the olive tree, and his smell as Lebanon.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> They that dwell under his shadow shall return; they shall revive as the corn, and grow as the vine: the scent thereof shall be as the wine of Lebanon.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Ephraim shall say, What have I to do any more with idols? I have heard him, and observed him: I am like a green fir tree. From me is thy fruit found.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Who is wise, and he shall understand these things? prudent, and he shall know them? for the ways of the LORD are right, and the just shall walk in them: but the transgressors shall fall therein.</span></div>
