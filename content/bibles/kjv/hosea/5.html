<div><h4>Hosea 5</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Hear ye this, O priests; and hearken, ye house of Israel; and give ye ear, O house of the king; for judgment is toward you, because ye have been a snare on Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And the revolters are profound to make slaughter, though I have been a rebuker of them all.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me: for now, O Ephraim, thou committest whoredom, and Israel is defiled.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> They will not frame their doings to turn unto their God: for the spirit of whoredoms is in the midst of them, and they have not known the LORD.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore shall Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity; Judah also shall fall with them.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the LORD; but they shall not find him; he hath withdrawn himself from them.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> They have dealt treacherously against the LORD: for they have begotten strange children: now shall a month devour them with their portions.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah: cry aloud at Beth-aven, after thee, O Benjamin.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> The princes of Judah were like them that remove the bound: therefore I will pour out my wrath upon them like water.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Ephraim is oppressed and broken in judgment, because he willingly walked after the commandment.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Therefore will I be unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah saw his wound, then went Ephraim to the Assyrian, and sent to king Jareb: yet could he not heal you, nor cure you of your wound.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah: I, even I, will tear and go away; I will take away, and none shall rescue him.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> I will go and return to my place, till they acknowledge their offence, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek me early.</span></div>
