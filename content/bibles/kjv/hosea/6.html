<div><h4>Hosea 6</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Come, and let us return unto the LORD: for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the LORD: his going forth is prepared as the morning; and he shall come unto us as the rain, as the latter and former rain unto the earth.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do unto thee? for your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goeth away.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and thy judgments are as the light that goeth forth.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> But they like men have transgressed the covenant: there have they dealt treacherously against me.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity, and is polluted with blood.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And as troops of robbers wait for a man, so the company of priests murder in the way by consent: for they commit lewdness.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> I have seen an horrible thing in the house of Israel: there is the whoredom of Ephraim, Israel is defiled.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Also, O Judah, he hath set an harvest for thee, when I returned the captivity of my people.</span></div>
