<div><h4>Hosea 10</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Israel is an empty vine, he bringeth forth fruit unto himself: according to the multitude of his fruit he hath increased the altars; according to the goodness of his land they have made goodly images.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Their heart is divided; now shall they be found faulty: he shall break down their altars, he shall spoil their images.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For now they shall say, We have no king, because we feared not the LORD; what then should a king do to us?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> They have spoken words, swearing falsely in making a covenant: thus judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the field.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> The inhabitants of Samaria shall fear because of the calves of Beth-aven: for the people thereof shall mourn over it, and the priests thereof that rejoiced on it, for the glory thereof, because it is departed from it.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> It shall be also carried unto Assyria for a present to king Jareb: Ephraim shall receive shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> As for Samaria, her king is cut off as the foam upon the water.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed: the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars; and they shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> O Israel, thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah: there they stood: the battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity did not overtake them.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> It is in my desire that I should chastise them; and the people shall be gathered against them, when they shall bind themselves in their two furrows.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And Ephraim is as an heifer that is taught, and loveth to tread out the corn; but I passed over upon her fair neck: I will make Ephraim to ride; Judah shall plow, and Jacob shall break his clods.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy; break up your fallow ground: for it is time to seek the LORD, till he come and rain righteousness upon you.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity; ye have eaten the fruit of lies: because thou didst trust in thy way, in the multitude of thy mighty men.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people, and all thy fortresses shall be spoiled, as Shalman spoiled Beth-arbel in the day of battle: the mother was dashed in pieces upon her children.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> So shall Bethel do unto you because of your great wickedness: in a morning shall the king of Israel utterly be cut off.</span></div>
