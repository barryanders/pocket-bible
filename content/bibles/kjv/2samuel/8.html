<div><h4>2 Samuel 8</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them: and David took Metheg-ammah out of the hand of the Philistines.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And he smote Moab, and measured them with a line, casting them down to the ground; even with two lines measured he to put to death, and with one full line to keep alive. And so the Moabites became David's servants, and brought gifts.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> David smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and David houghed all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for an hundred chariots.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus: and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought gifts. And the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And from Betah, and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David took exceeding much brass.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadadezer,</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Then Toi sent Joram his son unto king David, to salute him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer, and smitten him: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. And Joram brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass:</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Which also king David did dedicate unto the LORD, with the silver and gold that he had dedicated of all nations which he subdued;</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And David gat him a name when he returned from smiting of the Syrians in the valley of salt, being eighteen thousand men.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he garrisons, and all they of Edom became David's servants. And the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed judgment and justice unto all his people.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder;</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Seraiah was the scribe;</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over both the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chief rulers.</span></div>
