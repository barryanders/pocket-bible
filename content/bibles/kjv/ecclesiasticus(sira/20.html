<div><h4>Ecclesiasticus (Sira 20</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> There is a reproof that is not comely: again, some man holdeth his tongue, and he is wise.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> It is much better to reprove, than to be angry secretly: and he that confesseth his fault shall be preserved from hurt.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> How good is it, when thou art reproved, to shew repentance! for so shalt thou escape wilful sin.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> As is the lust of an eunuch to deflower a virgin; so is he that executeth judgment with violence.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> There is one that keepeth silence, and is found wise: and another by much babbling becometh hateful.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Some man holdeth his tongue, because he hath not to answer: and some keepeth silence, knowing his time.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> A wise man will hold his tongue till he see opportunity: but a babbler and a fool will regard no time.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> He that useth many words shall be abhorred; and he that taketh to himself authority therein shall be hated.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> There is a sinner that hath good success in evil things; and there is a gain that turneth to loss.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> There is a gift that shall not profit thee; and there is a gift whose recompence is double.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> There is an abasement because of glory; and there is that lifteth up his head from a low estate.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> There is that buyeth much for a little, and repayeth it sevenfold.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> A wise man by his words maketh him beloved: but the graces of fools shall be poured out.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> The gift of a fool shall do thee no good when thou hast it; neither yet of the envious for his necessity: for he looketh to receive many things for one.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> He giveth little, and upbraideth much; he openeth his mouth like a crier; to day he lendeth, and to morrow will he ask it again: such an one is to be hated of God and man.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> The fool saith, I have no friends, I have no thank for all my good deeds, and they that eat my bread speak evil of me.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> How oft, and of how many shall he be laughed to scorn! for he knoweth not aright what it is to have; and it is all one unto him as if he had it not.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> To slip upon a pavement is better than to slip with the tongue: so the fall of the wicked shall come speedily.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> An unseasonable tale will always be in the mouth of the unwise.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> A wise sentence shall be rejected when it cometh out of a fool's mouth; for he will not speak it in due season.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> There is that is hindered from sinning through want: and when he taketh rest, he shall not be troubled.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> There is that destroyeth his own soul through bashfulness, and by accepting of persons overthroweth himself.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> There is that for bashfulness promiseth to his friend, and maketh him his enemy for nothing.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> A lie is a foul blot in a man, yet it is continually in the mouth of the untaught.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> A thief is better than a man that is accustomed to lie: but they both shall have destruction to heritage.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> The disposition of a liar is dishonourable, and his shame is ever with him.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> A wise man shall promote himself to honour with his words: and he that hath understanding will please great men.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> He that tilleth his land shall increase his heap: and he that pleaseth great men shall get pardon for iniquity.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Presents and gifts blind the eyes of the wise, and stop up his mouth that he cannot reprove.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Wisdom that is hid, and treasure that is hoarded up, what profit is in them both?</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Better is he that hideth his folly than a man that hideth his wisdom.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> Necessary patience in seeking ing the Lord is better than he that leadeth his life without a guide.</span></div>
