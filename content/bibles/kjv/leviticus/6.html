<div><h4>Leviticus 6</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> If a soul sin, and commit a trespass against the LORD, and lie unto his neighbour in that which was delivered him to keep, or in fellowship, or in a thing taken away by violence, or hath deceived his neighbour;</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Or have found that which was lost, and lieth concerning it, and sweareth falsely; in any of all these that a man doeth, sinning therein:</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Then it shall be, because he hath sinned, and is guilty, that he shall restore that which he took violently away, or the thing which he hath deceitfully gotten, or that which was delivered him to keep, or the lost thing which he found,</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Or all that about which he hath sworn falsely; he shall even restore it in the principal, and shall add the fifth part more thereto, and give it unto him to whom it appertaineth, in the day of his trespass offering.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, a ram without blemish out of the flock, with thy estimation, for a trespass offering, unto the priest:</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And the priest shall make an atonement for him before the LORD: and it shall be forgiven him for any thing of all that he hath done in trespassing therein.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This is the law of the burnt offering: It is the burnt offering, because of the burning upon the altar all night unto the morning, and the fire of the altar shall be burning in it.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen breeches shall he put upon his flesh, and take up the ashes which the fire hath consumed with the burnt offering on the altar, and he shall put them beside the altar.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments, and carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it; it shall not be put out: and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and lay the burnt offering in order upon it; and he shall burn thereon the fat of the peace offerings.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> The fire shall ever be burning upon the altar; it shall never go out.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And this is the law of the meat offering: the sons of Aaron shall offer it before the LORD, before the altar.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And he shall take of it his handful, of the flour of the meat offering, and of the oil thereof, and all the frankincense which is upon the meat offering, and shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet savour, even the memorial of it, unto the LORD.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And the remainder thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat: with unleavened bread shall it be eaten in the holy place; in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation they shall eat it.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> It shall not be baken with leaven. I have given it unto them for their portion of my offerings made by fire; it is most holy, as is the sin offering, and as the trespass offering.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> All the males among the children of Aaron shall eat of it.
