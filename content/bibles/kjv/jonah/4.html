<div><h4>Jonah 4</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And he prayed unto the LORD, and said, I pray thee, O LORD, was not this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I fled before unto Tarshish: for I knew that thou art a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repentest thee of the evil.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Therefore now, O LORD, take, I beseech thee, my life from me; for it is better for me to die than to live.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Then said the LORD, Doest thou well to be angry?</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> So Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shadow, till he might see what would become of the city.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And the LORD God prepared a gourd, and made it to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him from his grief. So Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd that it withered.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And it came to pass, when the sun did arise, that God prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said, It is better for me to die than to live.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry, even unto death.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Then said the LORD, Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for the which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night:</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also much cattle?</span></div>
