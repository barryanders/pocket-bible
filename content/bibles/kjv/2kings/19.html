and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high? even against the Holy One of Israel.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> By the messengers thou hast reproached the Lord, and hast said, With the multitude of my chariots I am come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon, and will cut down the tall cedar trees thereof, and the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into the lodgings of his borders, and into the forest of his Carmel.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> I have digged and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of besieged places.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Hast thou not heard long ago how I have done it, and of ancient times that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that thou shouldest be to lay waste fenced cities into ruinous heaps.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, and as corn blasted before it be grown up.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy rage against me.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into mine ears, therefore I will put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> And this shall be a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year such things as grow of themselves, and in the second year that which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruits thereof.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall yet again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall do this.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shield, nor cast a bank against it.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, saith the LORD.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> For I will defend this city, to save it, for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> And it came to pass that night, that the angel of the LORD went out, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword: and they escaped into the land of Armenia.
