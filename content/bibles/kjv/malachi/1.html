<div><h4>Malachi 1</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The burden of the word of the LORD to Israel by Malachi.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> I have loved you, saith the LORD. Yet ye say, Wherein hast thou loved us? Was not Esau Jacob's brother? saith the LORD: yet I loved Jacob,</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Whereas Edom saith, We are impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places; thus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and they shall call them, The border of wickedness, and, The people against whom the LORD hath indignation for ever.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, The LORD will be magnified from the border of Israel.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> A son honoureth his father, and a servant his master: if then I be a father, where is mine honour? and if I be a master, where is my fear? saith the LORD of hosts unto you, O priests, that despise my name. And ye say, Wherein have we despised thy name?</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar; and ye say, Wherein have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of the LORD is contemptible.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? and if ye offer the lame and sick, is it not evil? offer it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person? saith the LORD of hosts.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And now, I pray you, beseech God that he will be gracious unto us: this hath been by your means: will he regard your persons? saith the LORD of hosts.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Who is there even among you that would shut the doors for nought? neither do ye kindle fire on mine altar for nought. I have no pleasure in you, saith the LORD of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense shall be offered unto my name, and a pure offering: for my name shall be great among the heathen, saith the LORD of hosts.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> But ye have profaned it, in that ye say, The table of the LORD is polluted; and the fruit thereof, even his meat, is contemptible.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Ye said also, Behold, what a weariness is it! and ye have snuffed at it, saith the LORD of hosts; and ye brought that which was torn, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye brought an offering: should I accept this of your hand? saith the LORD.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> But cursed be the deceiver, which hath in his flock a male, and voweth, and sacrificeth unto the LORD a corrupt thing: for I am a great King, saith the LORD of hosts, and my name is dreadful among the heathen.</span></div>
