<div><h4>2 Timothy 3</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all men, as theirs also was.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience,</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of them all the Lord delivered me.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them;</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.</span></div>
