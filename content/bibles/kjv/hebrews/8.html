<div><h4>Hebrews 8</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away.</span></div>
