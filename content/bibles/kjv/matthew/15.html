<div><h4>Matthew 15</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand:</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding?</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou Son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus' feet; and he healed them:</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> Then Jesus called his disciples unto him, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets full.</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children.</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala,</span></div>
