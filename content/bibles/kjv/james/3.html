<div><h4>James 3</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind:</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter?</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.</span></div>
