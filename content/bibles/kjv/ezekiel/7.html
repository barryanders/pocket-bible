<div><h4>Ezekiel 7</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Also, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD unto the land of Israel; An end, the end is come upon the four corners of the land.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Now is the end come upon thee, and I will send mine anger upon thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways, and will recompense upon thee all thine abominations.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And mine eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity: but I will recompense thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Thus saith the Lord GOD; An evil, an only evil, behold, is come.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> An end is come, the end is come: it watcheth for thee; behold, it is come.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> The morning is come unto thee, O thou that dwellest in the land: the time is come, the day of trouble is near, and not the sounding again of the mountains.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Now will I shortly pour out my fury upon thee, and accomplish mine anger upon thee: and I will judge thee according to thy ways, and will recompense thee for all thine abominations.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: I will recompense thee according to thy ways and thine abominations that are in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I am the LORD that smiteth.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Behold the day, behold, it is come: the morning is gone forth; the rod hath blossomed, pride hath budded.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness: none of them shall remain, nor of their multitude, nor of any of theirs: neither shall there be wailing for them.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn: for wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although they were yet alive: for the vision is touching the whole multitude thereof, which shall not return; neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> They have blown the trumpet, even to make all ready; but none goeth to the battle: for my wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> The sword is without, and the pestilence and the famine within: he that is in the field shall die with the sword; and he that is in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour him.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> But they that escape of them shall escape, and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning, every one for his iniquity.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak as water.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> They shall also gird themselves with sackcloth, and horror shall cover them; and shame shall be upon all faces, and baldness upon all their heads.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be removed: their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the LORD: they shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their bowels: because it is the stumblingblock of their iniquity.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty: but they made the images of their abominations and of their detestable things therein: therefore have I set it far from them.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall pollute it.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> My face will I turn also from them, and they shall pollute my secret place: for the robbers shall enter into it, and defile it.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Make a chain: for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Wherefore I will bring the worst of the heathen, and they shall possess their houses: I will also make the pomp of the strong to cease; and their holy places shall be defiled.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Destruction cometh; and they shall seek peace, and there shall be none.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumour shall be upon rumour; then shall they seek a vision of the prophet; but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the ancients.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled: I will do unto them after their way, and according to their deserts will I judge them; and they shall know that I am the LORD.</span></div>
