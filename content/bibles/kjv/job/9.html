<div><h4>Job 9</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Then Job answered and said,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> I know it is so of a truth: but how should man be just with God?</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened himself against him, and hath prospered?</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Which removeth the mountains, and they know not: which overturneth them in his anger.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders without number.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: he passeth on also, but I perceive him not.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto him, What doest thou?</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> If God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under him.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> How much less shall I answer him, and choose out my words to reason with him?</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer, but I would make supplication to my judge.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> If I had called, and he had answered me; yet would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with bitterness.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> If I speak of strength, lo, he is strong: and if of judgment, who shall set me a time to plead?</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: if I say, I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my soul: I would despise my life.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> This is one thing, therefore I said it, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, and who is he?</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Now my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no good.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle that hasteth to the prey.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my heaviness, and comfort myself:</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> If I be wicked, why then labour I in vain?</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean;</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, and we should come together in judgment.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, that might lay his hand upon us both.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify me:</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> Then would I speak, and not fear him; but it is not so with me.</span></div>
