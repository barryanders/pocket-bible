<div><h4>Psalms 16</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Preserve me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> O my soul, thou hast said unto the LORD, Thou art my Lord: my goodness extendeth not to thee;</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> But to the saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent, in whom is all my delight.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another god: their drink offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take up their names into my lips.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> The LORD is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou maintainest my lot.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> I will bless the LORD, who hath given me counsel: my reins also instruct me in the night seasons.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> I have set the LORD always before me: because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh also shall rest in hope.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.</span></div>
