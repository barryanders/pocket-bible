<div><h4>Psalms 32</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Blessed is the man unto whom the LORD imputeth not iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is turned into the drought of summer. Selah.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> I acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Thou art my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from trouble; thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they come near unto thee.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Many sorrows shall be to the wicked: but he that trusteth in the LORD, mercy shall compass him about.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, ye righteous: and shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart.</span></div>
