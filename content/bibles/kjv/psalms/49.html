<div><h4>Psalms 49</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Hear this, all ye people; give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world:</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Both low and high, rich and poor, together.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying upon the harp.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about?</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches;</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him:</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> (For the redemption of their soul is precious, and it ceaseth for ever:)</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> That he should still live for ever, and not see corruption.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For he seeth that wise men die, likewise the fool and the brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever, and their dwelling places to all generations; they call their lands after their own names.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Nevertheless man being in honour abideth not: he is like the beasts that perish.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> This their way is their folly: yet their posterity approve their sayings. Selah.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he shall receive me. Selah.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased;</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall not descend after him.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and men will praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see light.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Man that is in honour, and understandeth not, is like the beasts that perish.</span></div>
