<div><h4>Psalms 50</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The mighty God, even the LORD, hath spoken, and called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about him.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that he may judge his people.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God is judge himself. Selah.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testify against thee: I am God, even thy God.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt offerings, to have been continually before me.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> I will take no bullock out of thy house, nor he goats out of thy folds.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a thousand hills.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of the field are mine.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> If I were hungry, I would not tell thee: for the world is mine, and the fulness thereof.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the most High:</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth?</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Seeing thou hatest instruction, and castest my words behind thee.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him, and hast been partaker with adulterers.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest thine own mother's son.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> These things hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as thyself: but I will reprove thee, and set them in order before thine eyes.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me: and to him that ordereth his conversation aright will I shew the salvation of God.</span></div>
