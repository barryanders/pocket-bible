<div><h4>John 4</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> (Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,)</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And he must needs go through Samaria.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> (For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband:</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him ought to eat?</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours.</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did.</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days.</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> And many more believed because of his own word;</span><span class="42"> <sup>42</sup> And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.</span><span class="43"> <sup>43</sup> Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.</span><span class="44"> <sup>44</sup> For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country.</span><span class="45"> <sup>45</sup> Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.</span><span class="46"> <sup>46</sup> So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.</span><span class="47"> <sup>47</sup> When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.</span><span class="48"> <sup>48</sup> Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.</span><span class="49"> <sup>49</sup> The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.</span><span class="50"> <sup>50</sup> Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way.</span><span class="51"> <sup>51</sup> And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him, saying, Thy son liveth.</span><span class="52"> <sup>52</sup> Then inquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.</span><span class="53"> <sup>53</sup> So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house.</span><span class="54"> <sup>54</sup> This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee.</span></div>
