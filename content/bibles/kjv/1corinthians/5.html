<div><h4>1 Corinthians 5</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that hath so done this deed,</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators:</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within?</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.</span></div>
