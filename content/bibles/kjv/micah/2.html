<div><h4>Micah 2</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Woe to them that devise iniquity, and work evil upon their beds! when the morning is light, they practise it, because it is in the power of their hand.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And they covet fields, and take them by violence; and houses, and take them away: so they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, against this family do I devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks; neither shall ye go haughtily: for this time is evil.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> In that day shall one take up a parable against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation, and say, We be utterly spoiled: he hath changed the portion of my people: how hath he removed it from me! turning away he hath divided our fields.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot in the congregation of the LORD.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Prophesy ye not, say they to them that prophesy: they shall not prophesy to them, that they shall not take shame.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> O thou that art named the house of Jacob, is the spirit of the LORD straitened? are these his doings? do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Even of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye pull off the robe with the garment from them that pass by securely as men averse from war.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their children have ye taken away my glory for ever.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Arise ye, and depart; for this is not your rest: because it is polluted, it shall destroy you, even with a sore destruction.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> If a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie, saying, I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, as the flock in the midst of their fold: they shall make great noise by reason of the multitude of men.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> The breaker is come up before them: they have broken up, and have passed through the gate, and are gone out by it: and their king shall pass before them, and the LORD on the head of them.</span></div>
