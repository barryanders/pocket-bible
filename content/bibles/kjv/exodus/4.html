<div><h4>Exodus 4</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The LORD hath not appeared unto thee.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And the LORD said unto him, What is that in thine hand? And he said, A rod.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And the LORD said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it by the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand:</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> That they may believe that the LORD God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto thee.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And the LORD said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous as snow.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put his hand into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his bosom, and, behold, it was turned again as his other flesh.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land: and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And Moses said unto the LORD, O my Lord, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant: but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And the LORD said unto him, Who hath made man's mouth? or who maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I the LORD?</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt say.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And he said, O my Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt send.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses, and he said, Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well. And also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee: and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall be, even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him instead of God.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt do signs.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law, and said unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren which are in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive.
