<div><h4>Zechariah 9</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The burden of the word of the LORD in the land of Hadrach, and Damascus shall be the rest thereof: when the eyes of man, as of all the tribes of Israel, shall be toward the LORD.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And Hamath also shall border thereby; Tyrus, and Zidon, though it be very wise.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And Tyrus did build herself a strong hold, and heaped up silver as the dust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Behold, the Lord will cast her out, and he will smite her power in the sea; and she shall be devoured with fire.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Ashkelon shall see it, and fear; Gaza also shall see it, and be very sorrowful, and Ekron; for her expectation shall be ashamed; and the king shall perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his abominations from between his teeth: but he that remaineth, even he, shall be for our God, and he shall be as a governor in Judah, and Ekron as a Jebusite.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And I will encamp about mine house because of the army, because of him that passeth by, and because of him that returneth: and no oppressor shall pass through them any more: for now have I seen with mine eyes.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, thy King cometh unto thee: he is just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem, and the battle bow shall be cut off: and he shall speak peace unto the heathen: and his dominion shall be from sea even to sea, and from river even to the ends of the earth.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> As for thee also, by the blood of thy covenant I have sent forth thy prisoners out of the pit wherein is no water.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Turn you to the strong hold, ye prisoners of hope: even to day do I declare that I will render double unto thee;</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> When I have bent Judah for me, filled the bow with Ephraim, and raised up thy sons, O Zion, against thy sons, O Greece, and made thee as the sword of a mighty man.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And the LORD shall be seen over them, and his arrow shall go forth as the lightning: and the LORD GOD shall blow the trumpet, and shall go with whirlwinds of the south.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> The LORD of hosts shall defend them; and they shall devour, and subdue with sling stones; and they shall drink, and make a noise as through wine; and they shall be filled like bowls, and as the corners of the altar.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And the LORD their God shall save them in that day as the flock of his people: for they shall be as the stones of a crown, lifted up as an ensign upon his land.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> For how great is his goodness, and how great is his beauty! corn shall make the young men cheerful, and new wine the maids.</span></div>
