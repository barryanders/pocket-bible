<div><h4>Zechariah 10</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Ask ye of the LORD rain in the time of the latter rain; so the LORD shall make bright clouds, and give them showers of rain, to every one grass in the field.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For the idols have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a lie, and have told false dreams; they comfort in vain: therefore they went their way as a flock, they were troubled, because there was no shepherd.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Mine anger was kindled against the shepherds, and I punished the goats: for the LORD of hosts hath visited his flock the house of Judah, and hath made them as his goodly horse in the battle.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Out of him came forth the corner, out of him the nail, out of him the battle bow, out of him every oppressor together.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And they shall be as mighty men, which tread down their enemies in the mire of the streets in the battle: and they shall fight, because the LORD is with them, and the riders on horses shall be confounded.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph, and I will bring them again to place them; for I have mercy upon them: and they shall be as though I had not cast them off: for I am the LORD their God, and will hear them.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And they of Ephraim shall be like a mighty man, and their heart shall rejoice as through wine: yea, their children shall see it, and be glad; their heart shall rejoice in the LORD.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> I will hiss for them, and gather them; for I have redeemed them: and they shall increase as they have increased.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And I will sow them among the people: and they shall remember me in far countries; and they shall live with their children, and turn again.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt, and gather them out of Assyria; and I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Labanon; and place shall not be found for them.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And he shall pass through the sea with affliction, and shall smite the waves in the sea, and all the deeps of the river shall dry up: and the pride of Assyria shall be brought down, and the sceptre of Egypt shall depart away.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And I will strengthen them in the LORD; and they shall walk up and down in his name, saith the LORD.</span></div>
