<div><h4>Proverbs 27</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Boast not thyself of to morrow; for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth; a stranger, and not thine own lips.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> A stone is heavy, and the sand weighty; but a fool's wrath is heavier than them both.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Wrath is cruel, and anger is outrageous; but who is able to stand before envy?</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Open rebuke is better than secret love.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Faithful are the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> The full soul loatheth an honeycomb; but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> As a bird that wandereth from her nest, so is a man that wandereth from his place.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart: so doth the sweetness of a man's friend by hearty counsel.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Thine own friend, and thy father's friend, forsake not; neither go into thy brother's house in the day of thy calamity: for better is a neighbour that is near than a brother far off.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, that I may answer him that reproacheth me.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself; but the simple pass on, and are punished.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Take his garment that is surety for a stranger, and take a pledge of him for a strange woman.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, it shall be counted a curse to him.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Whosoever hideth her hideth the wind, and the ointment of his right hand, which bewrayeth itself.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof: so he that waiteth on his master shall be honoured.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> As in water face answereth to face, so the heart of man to man.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are never satisfied.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> As the fining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold; so is a man to his praise.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle, yet will not his foolishness depart from him.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, and look well to thy herds.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> For riches are not for ever: and doth the crown endure to every generation?</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> The hay appeareth, and the tender grass sheweth itself, and herbs of the mountains are gathered.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> The lambs are for thy clothing, and the goats are the price of the field.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> And thou shalt have goats' milk enough for thy food, for the food of thy household, and for the maintenance for thy maidens.</span></div>
