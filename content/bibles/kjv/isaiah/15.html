<div><h4>Isaiah 15</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The burden of Moab. Because in the night Ar of Moab is laid waste, and brought to silence; because in the night Kir of Moab is laid waste, and brought to silence;</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> He is gone up to Bajith, and to Dibon, the high places, to weep: Moab shall howl over Nebo, and over Medeba: on all their heads shall be baldness, and every beard cut off.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> In their streets they shall gird themselves with sackcloth: on the tops of their houses, and in their streets, every one shall howl, weeping abundantly.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And Heshbon shall cry, and Elealeh: their voice shall be heard even unto Jahaz: therefore the armed soldiers of Moab shall cry out; his life shall be grievous unto him.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> My heart shall cry out for Moab; his fugitives shall flee unto Zoar, an heifer of three years old: for by the mounting up of Luhith with weeping shall they go it up; for in the way of Horonaim they shall raise up a cry of destruction.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For the waters of Nimrim shall be desolate: for the hay is withered away, the grass faileth, there is no green thing.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Therefore the abundance they have gotten, and that which they have laid up, shall they carry away to the brook of the willows.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> For the cry is gone round about the borders of Moab; the howling thereof unto Eglaim, and the howling thereof unto Beer-elim.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For the waters of Dimon shall be full of blood: for I will bring more upon Dimon, lions upon him that escapeth of Moab, and upon the remnant of the land.</span></div>
