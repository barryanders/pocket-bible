<div><h4>Isaiah 51</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Hearken to me, ye that follow after righteousness, ye that seek the LORD: look unto the rock whence ye are hewn, and to the hole of the pit whence ye are digged.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Look unto Abraham your father, and unto Sarah that bare you: for I called him alone, and blessed him, and increased him.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For the LORD shall comfort Zion: he will comfort all her waste places; and he will make her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of the LORD; joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of melody.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Hearken unto me, my people; and give ear unto me, O my nation: for a law shall proceed from me, and I will make my judgment to rest for a light of the people.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> My righteousness is near; my salvation is gone forth, and mine arms shall judge the people; the isles shall wait upon me, and on mine arm shall they trust.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath: for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment, and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner: but my salvation shall be for ever, and my righteousness shall not be abolished.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, the people in whose heart is my law; fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye afraid of their revilings.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool: but my righteousness shall be for ever, and my salvation from generation to generation.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the LORD; awake, as in the ancient days, in the generations of old. Art thou not it that hath cut Rahab, and wounded the dragon?</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Art thou not it which hath dried the sea, the waters of the great deep; that hath made the depths of the sea a way for the ransomed to pass over?</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Therefore the redeemed of the LORD shall return, and come with singing unto Zion; and everlasting joy shall be upon their head: they shall obtain gladness and joy; and sorrow and mourning shall flee away.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> I, even I, am he that comforteth you: who art thou, that thou shouldest be afraid of a man that shall die, and of the son of man which shall be made as grass;</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And forgettest the LORD thy maker, that hath stretched forth the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth; and hast feared continually every day because of the fury of the oppressor, as if he were ready to destroy? and where is the fury of the oppressor?</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> The captive exile hasteneth that he may be loosed, and that he should not die in the pit, nor that his bread should fail.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> But I am the LORD thy God, that divided the sea, whose waves roared: The LORD of hosts is his name.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And I have put my words in thy mouth, and I have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion, Thou art my people.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which hast drunk at the hand of the LORD the cup of his fury; thou hast drunken the dregs of the cup of trembling, and wrung them out.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> There is none to guide her among all the sons whom she hath brought forth; neither is there any that taketh her by the hand of all the sons that she hath brought up.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> These two things are come unto thee; who shall be sorry for thee? desolation, and destruction, and the famine, and the sword: by whom shall I comfort thee?</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Thy sons have fainted, they lie at the head of all the streets, as a wild bull in a net: they are full of the fury of the LORD, the rebuke of thy God.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunken, but not with wine:</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Thus saith thy Lord the LORD, and thy God that pleadeth the cause of his people, Behold, I have taken out of thine hand the cup of trembling, even the dregs of the cup of my fury; thou shalt no more drink it again:</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> But I will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee; which have said to thy soul, Bow down, that we may go over: and thou hast laid thy body as the ground, and as the street, to them that went over.</span></div>
