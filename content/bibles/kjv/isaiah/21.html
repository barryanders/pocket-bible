<div><h4>Isaiah 21</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The burden of the desert of the sea. As whirlwinds in the south pass through; so it cometh from the desert, from a terrible land.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> A grievous vision is declared unto me; the treacherous dealer dealeth treacherously, and the spoiler spoileth. Go up, O Elam: besiege, O Media; all the sighing thereof have I made to cease.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Therefore are my loins filled with pain: pangs have taken hold upon me, as the pangs of a woman that travaileth: I was bowed down at the hearing of it; I was dismayed at the seeing of it.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> My heart panted, fearfulness affrighted me: the night of my pleasure hath he turned into fear unto me.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Prepare the table, watch in the watchtower, eat, drink: arise, ye princes, and anoint the shield.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Go, set a watchman, let him declare what he seeth.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And he saw a chariot with a couple of horsemen, a chariot of asses, and a chariot of camels; and he hearkened diligently with much heed:</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And he cried, A lion: My lord, I stand continually upon the watchtower in the daytime, and I am set in my ward whole nights:</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And, behold, here cometh a chariot of men, with a couple of horsemen. And he answered and said, Babylon is fallen, is fallen; and all the graven images of her gods he hath broken unto the ground.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> O my threshing, and the corn of my floor: that which I have heard of the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, have I declared unto you.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> The burden of Dumah. He calleth to me out of Seir, Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night: if ye will inquire, inquire ye: return, come.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> The burden upon Arabia. In the forest in Arabia shall ye lodge, O ye travelling companies of Dedanim.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> The inhabitants of the land of Tema brought water to him that was thirsty, they prevented with their bread him that fled.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> For they fled from the swords, from the drawn sword, and from the bent bow, and from the grievousness of war.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Within a year, according to the years of an hireling, and all the glory of Kedar shall fail:</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And the residue of the number of archers, the mighty men of the children of Kedar, shall be diminished: for the LORD God of Israel hath spoken it.</span></div>
