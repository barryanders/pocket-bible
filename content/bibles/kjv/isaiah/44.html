<div><h4>Isaiah 44</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Yet now hear, O Jacob my servant; and Israel, whom I have chosen:</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Thus saith the LORD that made thee, and formed thee from the womb, which will help thee; Fear not, O Jacob, my servant; and thou, Jesurun, whom I have chosen.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground: I will pour my spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thine offspring:</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And they shall spring up as among the grass, as willows by the water courses.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> One shall say, I am the LORD's; and another shall call himself by the name of Jacob; and another shall subscribe with his hand unto the LORD, and surname himself by the name of Israel.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Thus saith the LORD the King of Israel, and his redeemer the LORD of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And who, as I, shall call, and shall declare it, and set it in order for me, since I appointed the ancient people? and the things that are coming, and shall come, let them shew unto them.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Fear ye not, neither be afraid: have not I told thee from that time, and have declared it? ye are even my witnesses. Is there a God beside me? yea, there is no God; I know not any.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> They that make a graven image are all of them vanity; and their delectable things shall not profit; and they are their own witnesses; they see not, nor know; that they may be ashamed.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Who hath formed a god, or molten a graven image that is profitable for nothing?</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Behold, all his fellows shall be ashamed: and the workmen, they are of men: let them all be gathered together, let them stand up; yet they shall fear, and they shall be ashamed together.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> The smith with the tongs both worketh in the coals, and fashioneth it with hammers, and worketh it with the strength of his arms: yea, he is hungry, and his strength faileth: he drinketh no water, and is faint.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> The carpenter stretcheth out his rule; he marketh it out with a line; he fitteth it with planes, and he marketh it out with the compass, and maketh it after the figure of a man, according to the beauty of a man; that it may remain in the house.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> He heweth him down cedars, and taketh the cypress and the oak, which he strengtheneth for himself among the trees of the forest: he planteth an ash, and the rain doth nourish it.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Then shall it be for a man to burn: for he will take thereof, and warm himself; yea, he kindleth it, and baketh bread; yea, he maketh a god, and worshippeth it; he maketh it a graven image, and falleth down thereto.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> He burneth part thereof in the fire; with part thereof he eateth flesh; he roasteth roast, and is satisfied: yea, he warmeth himself, and saith, Aha, I am warm, I have seen the fire:</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And the residue thereof he maketh a god, even his graven image: he falleth down unto it, and worshippeth it, and prayeth unto it, and saith, Deliver me; for thou art my god.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> They have not known nor understood: for he hath shut their eyes, that they cannot see; and their hearts, that they cannot understand.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> And none considereth in his heart, neither is there knowledge nor understanding to say, I have burned part of it in the fire; yea, also I have baked bread upon the coals thereof; I have roasted flesh, and eaten it: and shall I make the residue thereof an abomination? shall I fall down to the stock of a tree?</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> He feedeth on ashes: a deceived heart hath turned him aside, that he cannot deliver his soul, nor say, Is there not a lie in my right hand?</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Remember these, O Jacob and Israel; for thou art my servant: I have formed thee; thou art my servant: O Israel, thou shalt not be forgotten of me.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for I have redeemed thee.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Sing, O ye heavens; for the LORD hath done it: shout, ye lower parts of the earth: break forth into singing, ye mountains, O forest, and every tree therein: for the LORD hath redeemed Jacob, and glorified himself in Israel.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Thus saith the LORD, thy redeemer, and he that formed thee from the womb, I am the LORD that maketh all things; that stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself;</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> That frustrateth the tokens of the liars, and maketh diviners mad; that turneth wise men backward, and maketh their knowledge foolish;</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> That confirmeth the word of his servant, and performeth the counsel of his messengers; that saith to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be inhabited; and to the cities of Judah, Ye shall be built, and I will raise up the decayed places thereof:</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> That saith to the deep, Be dry, and I will dry up thy rivers:</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> That saith of Cyrus, He is my shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure: even saying to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be built; and to the temple, Thy foundation shall be laid.</span></div>
