<div><h4>Isaiah 13</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz did see.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain, exalt the voice unto them, shake the hand, that they may go into the gates of the nobles.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> I have commanded my sanctified ones, I have also called my mighty ones for mine anger, even them that rejoice in my highness.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> The noise of a multitude in the mountains, like as of a great people; a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered together: the LORD of hosts mustereth the host of the battle.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> They come from a far country, from the end of heaven, even the LORD, and the weapons of his indignation, to destroy the whole land.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Howl ye; for the day of the LORD is at hand; it shall come as a destruction from the Almighty.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Therefore shall all hands be faint, and every man's heart shall melt:</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And they shall be afraid: pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them; they shall be in pain as a woman that travaileth: they shall be amazed one at another; their faces shall be as flames.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, cruel both with wrath and fierce anger, to lay the land desolate: and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light: the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And I will punish the world for their evil, and the wicked for their iniquity; and I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease, and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> I will make a man more precious than fine gold; even a man than the golden wedge of Ophir.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Therefore I will shake the heavens, and the earth shall remove out of her place, in the wrath of the LORD of hosts, and in the day of his fierce anger.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And it shall be as the chased roe, and as a sheep that no man taketh up: they shall every man turn to his own people, and flee every one into his own land.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Every one that is found shall be thrust through; and every one that is joined unto them shall fall by the sword.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Their children also shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes; their houses shall be spoiled, and their wives ravished.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, which shall not regard silver; and as for gold, they shall not delight in it.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Their bows also shall dash the young men to pieces; and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb; their eye shall not spare children.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees' excellency, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there; neither shall the shepherds make their fold there.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures; and owls shall dwell there, and satyrs shall dance there.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> And the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses, and dragons in their pleasant palaces: and her time is near to come, and her days shall not be prolonged.</span></div>
