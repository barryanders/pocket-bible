<div><h4>Isaiah 19</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The burden of Egypt. Behold, the LORD rideth upon a swift cloud, and shall come into Egypt: and the idols of Egypt shall be moved at his presence, and the heart of Egypt shall melt in the midst of it.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And I will set the Egyptians against the Egyptians: and they shall fight every one against his brother, and every one against his neighbour; city against city, and kingdom against kingdom.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And the spirit of Egypt shall fail in the midst thereof; and I will destroy the counsel thereof: and they shall seek to the idols, and to the charmers, and to them that have familiar spirits, and to the wizards.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And the Egyptians will I give over into the hand of a cruel lord; and a fierce king shall rule over them, saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And the waters shall fail from the sea, and the river shall be wasted and dried up.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And they shall turn the rivers far away; and the brooks of defence shall be emptied and dried up: the reeds and flags shall wither.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> The paper reeds by the brooks, by the mouth of the brooks, and every thing sown by the brooks, shall wither, be driven away, and be no more.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> The fishers also shall mourn, and all they that cast angle into the brooks shall lament, and they that spread nets upon the waters shall languish.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Moreover they that work in fine flax, and they that weave networks, shall be confounded.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And they shall be broken in the purposes thereof, all that make sluices and ponds for fish.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Surely the princes of Zoan are fools, the counsel of the wise counsellers of Pharaoh is become brutish: how say ye unto Pharaoh, I am the son of the wise, the son of ancient kings?</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Where are they? where are thy wise men? and let them tell thee now, and let them know what the LORD of hosts hath purposed upon Egypt.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> The princes of Zoan are become fools, the princes of Noph are deceived; they have also seduced Egypt, even they that are the stay of the tribes thereof.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> The LORD hath mingled a perverse spirit in the midst thereof: and they have caused Egypt to err in every work thereof, as a drunken man staggereth in his vomit.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Neither shall there be any work for Egypt, which the head or tail, branch or rush, may do.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> In that day shall Egypt be like unto women: and it shall be afraid and fear because of the shaking of the hand of the LORD of hosts, which he shaketh over it.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And the land of Judah shall be a terror unto Egypt, every one that maketh mention thereof shall be afraid in himself, because of the counsel of the LORD of hosts, which he hath determined against it.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> In that day shall five cities in the land of Egypt speak the language of Canaan, and swear to the LORD of hosts; one shall be called, The city of destruction.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> In that day shall there be an altar to the LORD in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar at the border thereof to the LORD.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> And it shall be for a sign and for a witness unto the LORD of hosts in the land of Egypt: for they shall cry unto the LORD because of the oppressors, and he shall send them a saviour, and a great one, and he shall deliver them.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> And the LORD shall be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians shall know the LORD in that day, and shall do sacrifice and oblation; yea, they shall vow a vow unto the LORD, and perform it.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> And the LORD shall smite Egypt: he shall smite and heal it: and they shall return even to the LORD, and he shall be intreated of them, and shall heal them.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> In that day shall there be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptian into Assyria, and the Egyptians shall serve with the Assyrians.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> In that day shall Israel be the third with Egypt and with Assyria, even a blessing in the midst of the land:</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Whom the LORD of hosts shall bless, saying, Blessed be Egypt my people, and Assyria the work of my hands, and Israel mine inheritance.</span></div>
