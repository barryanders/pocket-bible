<div><h4>Ecclesiastes 8</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Who is as the wise man? and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? a man's wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the boldness of his face shall be changed.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> I counsel thee to keep the king's commandment, and that in regard of the oath of God.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil thing; for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Where the word of a king is, there is power: and who may say unto him, What doest thou?</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a wise man's heart discerneth both time and judgment.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore the misery of man is great upon him.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For he knoweth not that which shall be: for who can tell him when it shall be?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> There is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit; neither hath he power in the day of death: and there is no discharge in that war; neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun: there is a time wherein one man ruleth over another to his own hurt.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the place of the holy, and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done: this is also vanity.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his days be prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear before him:</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong his days, which are as a shadow; because he feareth not before God.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be just men, unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked; again, there be wicked men, to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also is vanity.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life, which God giveth him under the sun.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth: (for also there is that neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes:)</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: because though a man labour to seek it out, yet he shall not find it; yea further; though a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be able to find it.</span></div>
