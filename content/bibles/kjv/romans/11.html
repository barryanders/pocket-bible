<div><h4>Romans 11</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye not what the scripture saith of Elias? how he maketh intercession to God against Israel, saying,</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> (According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumbling block, and a recompence unto them:</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back alway.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office:</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh, and might save some of them.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> For if the firstfruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if the root be holy, so are the branches.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree;</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear:</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be graffed in: for God is able to graff them in again.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be graffed into their own olive tree?</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> For this is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers' sakes.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counseller?</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever. Amen.</span></div>
