<div><h4>Romans 9</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh:</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Who are Israelites; to whom pertaineth the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises;</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Whose are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they are not all Israel, which are of Israel:</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For this is the word of promise, At this time will I come, and Sara shall have a son.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And not only this; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, even by our father Isaac;</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> (For the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth;)</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who hath resisted his will?</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus?</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction:</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory,</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles?</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> As he saith also in Osee, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people; there shall they be called the children of the living God.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved:</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> For he will finish the work, and cut it short in righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone;</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.</span></div>
