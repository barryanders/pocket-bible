<div><h4>Amos 7</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me; and, behold, he formed grasshoppers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth; and, lo, it was the latter growth after the king's mowings.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And it came to pass, that when they had made an end of eating the grass of the land, then I said, O Lord GOD, forgive, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he is small.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> The LORD repented for this: It shall not be, saith the LORD.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me: and, behold, the Lord GOD called to contend by fire, and it devoured the great deep, and did eat up a part.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Then said I, O Lord GOD, cease, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he is small.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> The LORD repented for this: This also shall not be, saith the Lord GOD.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Thus he shewed me: and, behold, the Lord stood upon a wall made by a plumbline, with a plumbline in his hand.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And the LORD said unto me, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A plumbline. Then said the Lord, Behold, I will set a plumbline in the midst of my people Israel: I will not again pass by them any more:</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of their own land.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Also Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thee away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there:</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> But prophesy not again any more at Bethel: for it is the king's chapel, and it is the king's court.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet's son; but I was an herdman, and a gatherer of sycomore fruit:</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And the LORD took me as I followed the flock, and the LORD said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Now therefore hear thou the word of the LORD: Thou sayest, Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not thy word against the house of Isaac.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Therefore thus saith the LORD; Thy wife shall be an harlot in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land shall be divided by line; and thou shalt die in a polluted land: and Israel shall surely go into captivity forth of his land.</span></div>
