<div><h4>Amos 2</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Moab, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime:</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> But I will send a fire upon Moab, and it shall devour the palaces of Kerioth: and Moab shall die with tumult, with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet:</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof, and will slay all the princes thereof with him, saith the LORD.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Judah, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have despised the law of the LORD, and have not kept his commandments, and their lies caused them to err, after the which their fathers have walked:</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> But I will send a fire upon Judah, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Israel, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they sold the righteous for silver, and the poor for a pair of shoes;</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> That pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, and turn aside the way of the meek: and a man and his father will go in unto the same maid, to profane my holy name:</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And they lay themselves down upon clothes laid to pledge by every altar, and they drink the wine of the condemned in the house of their god.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them, whose height was like the height of the cedars, and he was strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Also I brought you up from the land of Egypt, and led you forty years through the wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorite.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men for Nazarites. Is it not even thus, O ye children of Israel? saith the LORD.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> But ye gave the Nazarites wine to drink; and commanded the prophets, saying, Prophesy not.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Behold, I am pressed under you, as a cart is pressed that is full of sheaves.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Therefore the flight shall perish from the swift, and the strong shall not strengthen his force, neither shall the mighty deliver himself:</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Neither shall he stand that handleth the bow; and he that is swift of foot shall not deliver himself: neither shall he that rideth the horse deliver himself.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And he that is courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day, saith the LORD.</span></div>
