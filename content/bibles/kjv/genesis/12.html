And the Canaanite was then in the land.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD, who appeared unto him.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the LORD, and called upon the name of the LORD.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram's wife.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.</span></div>
