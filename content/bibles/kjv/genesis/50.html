<div><h4>Genesis 50</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and kissed him.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten days.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father's house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is beyond Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abel-mizraim, which is beyond Jordan.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying,</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we be thy servants.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God?</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house: and Joseph lived an hundred and ten years.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation: the children also of Machir the son Manasseh were brought up upon Joseph's knees.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.</span></div>
