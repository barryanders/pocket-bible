<div><h4>Genesis 41</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day:</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the captain of the guard's house, both me and the chief baker:</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river:</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow:</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine:</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they were still ill favoured, as at the beginning.
