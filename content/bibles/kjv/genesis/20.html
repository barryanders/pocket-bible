<div><h4>Genesis 20</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken; for she is a man's wife.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, Lord, wilt thou slay also a righteous nation?</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Said he not unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bare children.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife.</span></div>
