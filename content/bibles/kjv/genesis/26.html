<div><h4>Genesis 26</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of:</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father;</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife; lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she was fair to look upon.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is thy wife: and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great:</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> For he had possession of flocks, and possessions of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> For all the wells which his father's servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdmen, saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> And they digged another well, and strove for that also:and he called the name of it Sitnah.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> And he went up from thence to Beer-sheba.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants digged a well.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee: and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee;</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou art now the blessed of the LORD.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found water.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is Beer-sheba unto this day.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite:</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.</span></div>
