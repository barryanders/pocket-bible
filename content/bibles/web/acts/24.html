<div><h4>Acts 24</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> After five days, the high priest, Ananias, came down with certain elders and an orator, one Tertullus. They informed the governor against Paul.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> When he was called, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, "Seeing that by you we enjoy much peace, and that excellent measures are coming to this nation,</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> we accept it in all ways and in all places, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> But, that I don`t delay you, I entreat you to bear with us and hear a few words.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and an instigator of insurrections among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> He even tried to profane the temple. We arrested him.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> empty verses content detected by amos</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> By examining him yourself you may ascertain all these things of which we accuse him."</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> The Jews also joined in the attack, affirming that these things were so.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> When the governor had beckoned to him to speak, Paul answered, "Because I know that you have been a judge of this nation for many years, I cheerfully make my defense,</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> seeing that you can recognize that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship at Jerusalem.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> In the temple they didn`t find me disputing with anyone or stirring up a crowd, either in the synagogues, or in the city.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Nor can they prove to you the things whereof they now accuse me.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> But this I confess to you, that after the Way, which they call a sect, so I serve the God of our fathers, believing all things which are according to the law, and which are written in the prophets;</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> having hope toward God, which these also themselves look for, that there will be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Herein I also practice always having a conscience void of offense toward God and men.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Now after some years, I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings;</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> amid which they found me purified in the temple, with no crowd, nor yet with tumult. But certain Jews from Asia --</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> who ought to have been here before you, and to make accusation, if they had anything against me.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Or else let these men themselves say what injustice they found in me when I stood before the council,</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> unless it is for this one thing that I cried standing among them, `Concerning the resurrection of the dead I am being judged before you today!`"</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> But Felix, having more exact knowledge concerning the Way, deferred them, saying, "When Lysias, the commanding officer, comes down, I will decide your case."</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> He ordered the centurion that Paul should be kept in custody, and should have some privileges, and not to forbid any of his friends to serve him or to visit him.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> But after some days, Felix came with Drusilla, his wife, who was a Jewess, and sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ Jesus.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> As he reasoned about righteousness, self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix was terrified, and answered, "Go your way for this time, and when it is convenient for me, I will call you to me."</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> He hoped that way that money would be given to him by Paul, that he might release him. Therefore also he sent for him more often, and talked with him.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> But when two years were fulfilled, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus, and desiring to gain favor with the Jews, Felix left Paul in bonds.</span></div>
