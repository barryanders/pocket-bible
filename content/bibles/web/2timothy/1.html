<div><h4>2 Timothy 1</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, according to the promise of the life which is in Christ Jesus,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> to Timothy, my beloved child: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God, the Father, and Christ Jesus, our Lord.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> I thank God, whom I serve as my forefathers did, with a pure conscience. How unceasing is my memory of you in my petitions, night and day</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> longing to see you, remembering your tears, that I may be filled with joy;</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> having been reminded of the unfeigned faith that is in you; which lived first in your grandmother Lois, and your mother Eunice, and, I am persuaded, in you also.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For this cause, I remind you that you should stir up the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For God didn`t give us a spirit of fear, but of power and love and discipline.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Don`t be ashamed therefore of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me, his prisoner; but suffer hardship with the gospel according to the power of God,</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> who saved us, and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before times eternal,</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> but has now been revealed by the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For this, I was appointed as a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> For this cause I suffer also these things. Yet I am not ashamed, for I know him whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to guard that which I have committed to him against that day.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Hold the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> That good thing which was committed to you, guard through the Holy Spirit which dwells in us.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> This you know, that all who are in Asia turned away from me; of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> May the Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain,</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> but when he was in Rome, he sought me diligently, and found me</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> (the Lord grant to him to find the Lord`s mercy in that day); and in how many things he served at Ephesus, you know very well.</span></div>
