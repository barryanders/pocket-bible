<div><h4>Luke 23</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The whole company of them rose up and brought him before Pilate.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> They began to accuse him, saying, "We found this man perverting the nation, forbidding paying taxes to Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ, a king."</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Pilate asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?"     He answered him, "So you say."</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Pilate said to the chief priests and the multitudes, "I find no basis for a charge against this man."</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> But they insisted, saying, "He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee even to this place."</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> But when Pilate heard Galilee mentioned, he asked if the man was a Galilean.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> When he found out that he was in Herod`s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem in those days.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceedingly glad, for he had wanted to see him for a long time, because he had heard many things about him. He hoped to see some miracle done by him.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> He questioned him with many words, but he gave no answers.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> The chief priests and the scribes stood, vehemently accusing him.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Herod with his soldiers humiliated him and mocked him. Dressing him in luxurious clothing, they sent him back to Pilate.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day, for before that they were enemies with each other.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Pilate called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> and said to them, "You brought this man to me as one that perverts the people, and see, I have examined him before you, and found no basis for a charge against this man concerning those things of which you accuse him.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Neither has Herod, for I sent you to him, and see, nothing worthy of death has been done by him.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> I will therefore chastise him and release him."</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Now he had to release one prisoner to them at the feast.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> But they all cried out together, saying, "Away with this man! Release to us Barabbas!" --</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> one who was thrown into prison for a certain revolt in the city, and for murder.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Pilate spoke to them again, desiring to release Jesus,</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> but they shouted, saying, "Crucify! Crucify him!"</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> He said to them the third time, "Why? What evil has this man done? I have found no capital crime in him. I will therefore chastise him and release him."</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> But they were urgent with loud voices, asking that he might be crucified. Their voices and the voices of the chief priests prevailed.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Pilate adjudged that what they asked for should be done.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> He released him who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, for whom they asked, but he delivered Jesus up to their will.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> When they led him away, they grabbed one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, and laid on him the cross, to carry it after Jesus.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> A great multitude of the people followed him, including women who also mourned and lamented him.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> But Jesus, turning to them, said, "Daughters of Jerusalem, don`t weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> For behold, the days are coming in which they will say, `Blessed are the barren, the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed.`</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Then will they begin to tell the mountains, `Fall on us!` and to the hills, `Cover us.`</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> For if they do these things in the green tree, what will be done in the dry?"</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> There were also others, two criminals, led with him to be put to death.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> When they came to the place that is called The Skull, they crucified him there with the criminals, one on the right and the other on the left.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, for they don`t know what they are doing."     Dividing his garments among them, they cast lots.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> The people stood watching. The rulers with them also scoffed at him, saying, "He saved others. Let him save himself, if this is the Christ of God, his chosen one!"</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> The soldiers also mocked him, coming to him and offering him vinegar,</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> and saying, "If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!"</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> An inscription was also written over him in letters of Greek, Latin, and Hebrew: "THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS."</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> One of the criminals who was hanged insulted him, saying, "If you are the Christ, save yourself and us!"</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> But the other answered, and rebuking him said, "Don`t you even fear God, seeing you are in the same condemnation?</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> And we indeed justly, for we receive the due reward for our deeds, but this man has done nothing wrong."</span><span class="42"> <sup>42</sup> He said to Jesus, "Lord, remember me when you come into your kingdom."</span><span class="43"> <sup>43</sup> He said to him, "Most assuredly I tell you, today you will be with me in Paradise."</span><span class="44"> <sup>44</sup> It was now about the sixth hour, and darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour.</span><span class="45"> <sup>45</sup> The sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was torn in two.</span><span class="46"> <sup>46</sup> Jesus, crying with a loud voice, said, "Father, into your hands I commit my spirit!" Having said this, he breathed his last.</span><span class="47"> <sup>47</sup> When the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, "Certainly this was a righteous man."</span><span class="48"> <sup>48</sup> All the multitudes that came together to see this, when they saw the things that were done, returned beating their breasts.</span><span class="49"> <sup>49</sup> All his acquaintances, and the women who followed with him from Galilee, stood far away, watching these things.</span><span class="50"> <sup>50</sup> Behold, a man named Joseph, who was a member of the council, a good and righteous man</span><span class="51"> <sup>51</sup> (he had not consented to their counsel and deed), from Arimathaea, a city of the Jews, who was also waiting for the kingdom of God:</span><span class="52"> <sup>52</sup> this man went to Pilate, and asked for Jesus` body.</span><span class="53"> <sup>53</sup> He took it down, and wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb that was cut in stone, where no man had ever yet lain.</span><span class="54"> <sup>54</sup> It was the day of the Preparation, and the Sabbath was coming on.</span><span class="55"> <sup>55</sup> The women, who had come with him out of Galilee, followed after, and saw the tomb, and how his body was laid.</span><span class="56"> <sup>56</sup> They returned, and prepared spices and ointments. On the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment.</span></div>
