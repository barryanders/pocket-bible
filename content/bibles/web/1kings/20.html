<div><h4>1 Kings 20</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Ben-hadad the king of Syria gathered all his host together; and there were thirty-two kings with him, and horses and chariots: and he went up and besieged Samaria, and fought against it.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> He sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel, into the city, and said to him, Thus says Ben-hadad,</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Your silver and your gold is mine; your wives also and your children, even the best, are mine.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> The king of Israel answered, It is according to your saying, my lord, O king; I am yours, and all that I have.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> The messengers came again, and said, Thus speaks Ben-hadad, saying, I sent indeed to you, saying, You shall deliver me your silver, and your gold, and your wives, and your children;</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> but I will send my servants to you tomorrow about this time, and they shall search your house, and the houses of your servants; and it shall be, that whatever is pleasant in your eyes, they shall put it in their hand, and take it away.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said, Please notice how this man seeks mischief: for he sent to me for my wives, and for my children, and for my silver, and for my gold; and I didn`t deny him.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> All the elders and all the people said to him, Don`t you listen, neither consent.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Therefore he said to the messengers of Ben-hadad, Tell my lord the king, All that you did send for to your servant at the first I will do; but this thing I may not do. The messengers departed, and brought him word again.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Ben-hadad sent to him, and said, The gods do so to me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people who follow me.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> The king of Israel answered, Tell him, Don`t let him who girds on [his armor] boast himself as he who puts it off.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> It happened, when [Ben-hadad] heard this message, as he was drinking, he and the kings, in the pavilions, that he said to his servants, Set [yourselves in array]. They set [themselves in array] against the city.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Behold, a prophet came near to Ahab king of Israel, and said, Thus says Yahweh, Have you seen all this great multitude? behold, I will deliver it into your hand this day; and you shall know that I am Yahweh.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Ahab said, By whom? He said, Thus says Yahweh, By the young men of the princes of the provinces. Then he said, Who shall begin the battle? He answered, You.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Then he mustered the young men of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty-two: and after them he mustered all the people, even all the children of Israel, being seven thousand.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> They went out at noon. But Ben-hadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty-two kings who helped him.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> The young men of the princes of the provinces went out first; and Ben-hadad sent out, and they told him, saying, There are men come out from Samaria.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> He said, Whether they are come out for peace, take them alive, or whether they are come out for war, taken them alive.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> So these went out of the city, the young men of the princes of the provinces, and the army which followed them.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> They killed everyone his man; and the Syrians fled, and Israel pursued them: and Ben-hadad the king of Syria escaped on a horse with horsemen.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> The king of Israel went out, and struck the horses and chariots, and killed the Syrians with a great slaughter.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> The prophet came near to the king of Israel, and said to him, Go, strengthen yourself, and mark, and see what you do; for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against you.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> The servants of the king of Syria said to him, Their god is a god of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we: but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Do this thing: take the kings away, every man out of his place, and put captains in their room;</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> and number you an army, like the army that you have lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot; and we will fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they. He listened to their voice, and did so.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> It happened at the return of the year, that Ben-hadad mustered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> The children of Israel were mustered, and were provisioned, and went against them: and the children of Israel encamped before them like two little flocks of kids; but the Syrians filled the country.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> A man of God came near and spoke to the king of Israel, and said, Thus says Yahweh, Because the Syrians have said, Yahweh is a god of the hills, but he is not a god of the valleys; therefore will I deliver all this great multitude into your hand, and you shall know that I am Yahweh.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> They encamped one over against the other seven days. So it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined; and the children of Israel killed of the Syrians one hundred thousand footmen in one day.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and the wall fell on twenty-seven thousand men who were left. Ben-hadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner chamber.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> His servants said to him, See now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings: let us, we pray you, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes on our heads, and go out to the king of Israel: peradventure he will save your life.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and [put] ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, Your servant Ben-hadad says, please let me live. He said, Is he yet alive? he is my brother.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> Now the men observed diligently, and hurried to catch whether it were his mind; and they said, Your brother Ben-hadad. Then he said, Go you, bring him. Then Ben-hadad came forth to him; and he caused him to come up into the chariot.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> [Ben-hadad] said to him, The cities which my father took from your father I will restore; and you shall make streets for you in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. I, [said Ahab], will let you go with this covenant. So he made a covenant with him, and let him go.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> A certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his fellow by the word of Yahweh, Please strike me. The man refused to strike him.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> Then said he to him, Because you have not obeyed the voice of Yahweh, behold, as soon as you are departed from me, a lion shall kill you. As soon as he was departed from him, a lion found him, and killed him.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> Then he found another man, and said, Please strike me. The man struck him, smiting and wounding him.</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with his headband over his eyes.</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> As the king passed by, he cried to the king; and he said, Your servant went out into the midst of the battle; and, behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man to me, and said, Keep this man: if by any means he be missing, then shall your life be for his life, or else you shall pay a talent of silver.</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> As your servant was busy here and there, he was gone. The king of Israel said to him, So shall your judgment be; yourself have decided it.</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> He hurried, and took the headband away from his eyes; and the king of Israel discerned him that he was of the prophets.</span><span class="42"> <sup>42</sup> He said to him, Thus says Yahweh, Because you have let go out of your hand the man whom I had devoted to destruction, therefore your life shall go for his life, and your people for his people.</span><span class="43"> <sup>43</sup> The king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased, and came to Samaria.</span></div>
