<div><h4>Amos 6</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Woe to those who are at ease in Zion, and to those who are secure in the mountain of Samaria, the notable men of the chief of the nations, to whom the house of Israel come!</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Pass you to Calneh, and see; and from there go you to Hamath the great; then go down to Gath of the Philistines: are they better than these kingdoms? or is their border greater than your border?</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> -you who put far away the evil day, and cause the seat of violence to come near;</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> who lie on beds of ivory, and stretch themselves on their couches, and eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves out of the midst of the stall;</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> who sing idle songs to the sound of the violin; who invent for themselves instruments of music, like David;</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> who drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the chief oils; but they are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Therefore shall they now go captive with the first who go captive; and the revelry of those who stretched themselves shall pass away.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> The Lord Yahweh has sworn by himself, says Yahweh, the God of hosts: I abhor the excellency of Jacob, and hate his palaces; therefore will I deliver up the city with all that is therein.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> It shall happen, if there remain ten men in one house, that they shall die.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> When a man`s uncle shall take him up, even he who burns him, to bring out the bones out of the house, and shall tell him who is in the innermost parts of the house, Is there yet any with you? and he shall say, No; then shall he say, Hold your peace; for we may not make mention of the name of Yahweh.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For, behold, Yahweh commands, and the great house shall be struck with breaches, and the little house with clefts.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Shall horses run on the rock? will one plow [there] with oxen? that you have turned justice into gall, and the fruit of righteousness into wormwood;</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> you who rejoice in a thing of nothing, who say, Haven`t we taken to us horns by our own strength?</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> For, behold, I will raise up against you a nation, house of Israel, says Yahweh, the God of hosts; and they shall afflict you from the entrance of Hamath to the brook of the Arabah.</span></div>
