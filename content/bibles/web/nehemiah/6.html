<div><h4>Nehemiah 6</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Now it happened, when it was reported to Sanballat and Tobiah, and to Geshem the Arabian, and to the rest of our enemies, that I had built the wall, and that there was no breach left therein; (though even to that time I had not set up the doors in the gates;)</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> that Sanballat and Geshem sent to me, saying, Come, let us meet together in [one of] the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> I sent messengers to them, saying, I am doing a great work, so that I can`t come down: why should the work cease, while I leave it, and come down to you?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> They sent to me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Then sent Sanballat his servant to me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand,</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> in which was written, It is reported among the nations, and Gashmu says it, that you and the Jews think to rebel; for which cause you are building the wall: and you would be their king, according to these words.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> You have also appointed prophets to preach of you at Jerusalem, saying, There is a king in Judah: and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Then I sent to him, saying, There are no such things done as you say, but you feign them out of your own heart.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For they all would have made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it not be done. But now, [God], strengthen you my hands.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> I went to the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to kill you; yes, in the night will they come to kill you.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there that, being such as I, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> I discerned, and, behold, God had not sent him; but he pronounced this prophecy against me: and Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> For this cause was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they might reproach me.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Remember, my God, Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and also the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> So the wall was finished in the twenty-fifth [day] of [the month] Elul, in fifty-two days.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> It happened, when all our enemies heard [of it], that all the nations that were about us feared, and were much cast down in their own eyes; for they perceived that this work was worked of our God.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah, and [the letters] of Tobiah came to them.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> For there were many in Judah sworn to him, because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of Arah; and his son Jehohanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah as wife.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Also they spoke of his good deeds before me, and reported my words to him. Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.</span></div>
