<div><h4>Joshua 6</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Now Jericho was tightly shut up because of the children of Israel: none went out, and none came in.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Yahweh said to Joshua, Behold, I have given into your hand Jericho, and the king of it, and the mighty men of valor.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> You shall compass the city, all the men of war, going about the city once. Thus shall you do six days.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Seven priests shall bear seven trumpets of rams` horns before the ark: and the seventh day you shall compass the city seven times, and the priests shall blow the trumpets.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> It shall be that when they make a long blast with the ram`s horn, and when you hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall go up every man straight before him.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said to them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams` horns before the ark of Yahweh.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> They said to the people, Pass on, and compass the city, and let the armed men pass on before the ark of Yahweh.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> It was so, that when Joshua had spoken to the people, the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams` horns before Yahweh passed on, and blew the trumpets: and the ark of the covenant of Yahweh followed them.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> The armed men went before the priests who blew the trumpets, and the rearward went after the ark, [the priests] blowing the trumpets as they went.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Joshua commanded the people, saying, You shall not shout, nor let your voice be heard, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout; then shall you shout.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> So he caused the ark of Yahweh to compass the city, going about it once: and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of Yahweh.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> The seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams` horns before the ark of Yahweh went on continually, and blew the trumpets: and the armed men went before them; and the rearward came after the ark of Yahweh, [the priests] blowing the trumpets as they went.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> The second day they compassed the city once, and returned into the camp: so they did six days.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> It happened on the seventh day, that they rose early at the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same manner seven times: only on the day they compassed the city seven times.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> It happened at the seventh time, when the priests blew the trumpets, Joshua said to the people, Shout; for Yahweh has given you the city.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> The city shall be devoted, even it and all that is therein, to Yahweh: only Rahab the prostitute shall live, she and all who are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> But as for you, only keep yourselves from the devoted thing, lest when you have devoted it, you take of the devoted thing; so would you make the camp of Israel accursed, and trouble it.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are holy to Yahweh: they shall come into the treasury of Yahweh.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> So the people shouted, and [the priests] blew the trumpets; and it happened, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, that the people shouted with a great shout, and the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> They utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, both young and old, and ox, and sheep, and donkey, with the edge of the sword.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land, Go into the prostitute`s house, and bring out there the woman, and all that she has, as you swore to her.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> The young men the spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brothers, and all that she had; all her relatives also they brought out; and they set them outside of the camp of Israel.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> They burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein; only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of Yahweh.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> But Rahab the prostitute, and her father`s household, and all that she had, did Joshua save alive; and she lived in the midst of Israel to this day, because she hid the messengers, whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Joshua charged them with an oath at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before Yahweh, that rises up and builds this city Jericho: with the loss of his firstborn shall he lay the foundation of it, and with the loss of his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> So Yahweh was with Joshua; and his fame was in all the land.</span></div>
