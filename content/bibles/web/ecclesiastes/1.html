<div><h4>Ecclesiastes 1</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem:</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> "Vanity of vanities," says the Preacher; "Vanity of vanities, all is vanity."</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> What does man gain from all his labor in which he labors under the sun?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> One generation goes, and another generation comes; but the earth remains forever.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> The sun also rises, and the sun goes down, and hurries to its place where it rises.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> The wind goes toward the south, and turns around to the north. It turns around continually as it goes, and the wind returns again to its courses.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full. To the place where the rivers flow, there they flow again.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> All things are full of weariness beyond uttering. The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> That which has been is that which shall be; and that which has been done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Is there a thing of which it may be said, "Behold, this is new?" It has been long ago, in the ages which were before us.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> There is no memory of the former; neither shall there be any memory of the latter that are to come, among those that shall come after.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> I, the Preacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under the sky. It is a heavy burden that God has given to the sons of men to be afflicted with.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and a chasing after wind.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> That which is crooked can`t be made straight; and that which is lacking can`t be counted.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> I said to myself, "Behold, I have obtained for myself great wisdom above all who were before me in Jerusalem. Yes, my heart has had great experience of wisdom and knowledge."</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly. I perceived that this also was a chasing after wind.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> For in much wisdom is much grief; and he who increases knowledge increases sorrow.</span></div>
