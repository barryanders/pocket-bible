<div><h4>1 Samuel 11</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against Jabesh-gilead: and all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, Make a covenant with us, and we will serve you.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Nahash the Ammonite said to them, On this condition will I make it with you, that all your right eyes be put out; and I will lay it for a reproach on all Israel.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> The elders of Jabesh said to him, Give us seven days` respite, that we may send messengers to all the borders of Israel; and then, if there be none to save us, we will come out to you.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and spoke these words in the ears of the people: and all the people lifted up their voice, and wept.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Behold, Saul came following the oxen out of the field; and Saul said, What ails the people that they weep? They told him the words of the men of Jabesh.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> The Spirit of God came mightily on Saul when he heard those words, and his anger was kindled greatly.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> He took a yoke of oxen, and cut them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the borders of Israel by the hand of messengers, saying, Whoever doesn`t come forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done to his oxen. The dread of Yahweh fell on the people, and they came out as one man.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> He numbered them in Bezek; and the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> They said to the messengers who came, Thus shall you tell the men of Jabesh-gilead, Tomorrow, by the time the sun is hot, you shall have deliverance. The messengers came and told the men of Jabesh; and they were glad.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Therefore the men of Jabesh said, Tomorrow we will come out to you, and you shall do with us all that seems good to you.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> It was so on the next day, that Saul put the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the camp in the morning watch, and struck the Ammonites until the heat of the day: and it happened, that those who remained were scattered, so that no two of them were left together.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> The people said to Samuel, Who is he who said, Shall Saul reign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to death.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day; for today Yahweh has worked deliverance in Israel.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> All the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before Yahweh in Gilgal; and there they offered sacrifices of peace-offerings before Yahweh; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.</span></div>
