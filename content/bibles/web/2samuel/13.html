<div><h4>2 Samuel 13</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> It happened after this, that Absalom the son of David had a beautiful sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Amnon was so vexed that he fell sick because of his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin; and it seemed hard to Amnon to do anything to her.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David`s brother; and Jonadab was a very subtle man.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> He said to him, Why, son of the king, are you thus lean from day to day? Won`t you tell me? Amnon said to him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom`s sister.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Jonadab said to him, Lay you down on your bed, and feign yourself sick: and when your father comes to see you, tell him, Please let my sister Tamar come and give me bread to eat, and dress the food in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it from her hand.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> So Amnon lay down, and feigned himself sick: and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said to the king, Please let her sister Tamar come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat from her hand.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to your brother Amnon`s house, and dress him food.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> So Tamar went to her brother Amnon`s house; and he was laid down. She took dough, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> She took the pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. Amnon said, Have out all men from me. They went out every man from him.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Amnon said to Tamar, Bring the food into the chamber, that I may eat from your hand. Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> When she had brought them near to him to eat, he took hold of her, and said to her, Come, lie with me, my sister.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> She answered him, No, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel. Don`t you do this folly.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> I, where shall I carry my shame? and as for you, you will be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, please speak to the king; for he will not withhold me from you.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> However he would not listen to her voice; but being stronger than she, he forced her, and lay with her.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Then Amnon hated her with exceeding great hatred; for the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. Amnon said to her, Arise, be gone.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> She said to him, Not so, because this great wrong in putting me forth is [worse] than the other that you did to me. But he would not listen to her.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Then he called his servant who ministered to him, and said, Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> She had a garment of various colors on her; for with such robes were the king`s daughters who were virgins dressed. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Tamar put ashes on her head, and tore her garment of various colors that was on her; and she laid her hand on her head, and went her way, crying aloud as she went.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Absalom her brother said to her, Has Amnon your brother been with you? but now hold your peace, my sister: he is your brother; don`t take this thing to heart. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom`s house.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> But when king David heard of all these things, he was very angry.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Absalom spoke to Amnon neither good nor bad; for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> It happened after two full years, that Absalom had sheep-shearers in Baal-hazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king`s sons.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Absalom came to the king, and said, See now, your servant has sheep-shearers; let the king, I pray you, and his servants go with your servant.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> The king said to Absalom, No, my son, let us not all go, lest we be burdensome to you. He pressed him: however he would not go, but blessed him.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Then said Absalom, If not, please let my brother Amnon go with us. The king said to him, Why should he go with you?</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> But Absalom pressed him, and he let Amnon and all the king`s sons go with him.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Absalom commanded his servants, saying, Mark you now, when Amnon`s heart is merry with wine; and when I tell you, Smite Amnon, then kill him; don`t be afraid; haven`t I commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> The servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king`s sons arose, and every man got him up on his mule, and fled.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> It happened, while they were in the way, that the news came to David, saying, Absalom has slain all the king`s sons, and there is not one of them left.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Then the king arose, and tore his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes torn.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David`s brother, answered, Don`t let my lord suppose that they have killed all the young men the king`s sons; for Amnon only is dead; for by the appointment of Absalom this has been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> Now therefore don`t let my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king`s sons are dead; for Amnon only is dead.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> But Absalom fled. The young man who kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people by the way of the hill-side behind him.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> Jonadab said to the king, Behold, the king`s sons are come: as your servant said, so it is.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> It happened, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that behold, the king`s sons came, and lifted up their voice, and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept very sore.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai the son of Ammihur, king of Geshur. [David] mourned for his son every day.</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> [the soul of] king David longed to go forth to Absalom: for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.</span></div>
