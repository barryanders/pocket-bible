<div><h4>Isaiah 31</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help, and rely on horses, and trust in chariots because they are many, and in horsemen because they are very strong, but they don`t look to the Holy One of Israel, neither seek Yahweh!</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Yet he also is wise, and will bring evil, and will not call back his words, but will arise against the house of the evil-doers, and against the help of those who work iniquity.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Now the Egyptians are men, and not God; and their horses flesh, and not spirit: and when Yahweh shall stretch out his hand, both he who helps shall stumble, and he who is helped shall fall, and they all shall be consumed together.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For thus says Yahweh to me, As the lion and the young lion growling over his prey, if a multitude of shepherds are called forth against him, will not be dismayed at their voice, nor abase himself for the noise of them: so will Yahweh of Hosts come down to fight on Mount Zion, and on the hill of it.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> As birds hovering, so will Yahweh of Hosts protect Jerusalem; he will protect and deliver [it], he will pass over and preserve [it].</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Turn you to him from whom you have deeply revolted, children of Israel.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For in that day they shall cast away every man his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which your own hands have made to you for a sin.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> The Assyrian shall fall by the sword, not of man; and the sword, not of men, shall devour him; and he shall flee from the sword, and his young men shall become subject to forced labor.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> His rock shall pass away by reason of terror, and his princes shall be dismayed at the ensign, says Yahweh, whose fire is in Zion, and his furnace in Jerusalem.</span></div>
