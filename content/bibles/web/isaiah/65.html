<div><h4>Isaiah 65</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> I am inquired of by those who didn`t ask; I am found by those who didn`t seek me: I said, See me, see me, to a nation that was not called by my name.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> I have spread out my hands all the day to a rebellious people, who walk in a way that is not good, after their own thoughts;</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> a people who provoke me to my face continually, sacrificing in gardens, and burning incense on bricks;</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> who sit among the graves, and lodge in the secret places; who eat pig`s flesh, and broth of abominable things is in their vessels;</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> who say, Stand by yourself, don`t come near to me, for I am holier than you. These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burns all the day.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Behold, it is written before me: I will not keep silence, but will recompense, yes, I will recompense into their bosom,</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> your own iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, says Yahweh, who have burned incense on the mountains, and blasphemed me on the hills; therefore will I first measure their work into their bosom.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Thus says Yahweh, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and one says, Don`t destroy it, for a blessing is in it: so will I do for my servants` sake, that I may not destroy them all.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains; and my chosen shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for herds to lie down in, for my people who have sought me.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> But you who forsake Yahweh, who forget my holy mountain, who prepare a table for Fortune, and who fill up mingled wine to Destiny;</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> I will destine you to the sword, and you shall all bow down to the slaughter; because when I called, you did not answer; when I spoke, you did not hear; but you did that which was evil in my eyes, and chose that in which I didn`t delight.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh, Behold, my servants shall eat, but you shall be hungry; behold, my servants shall drink, but you shall be thirsty; behold, my servants shall rejoice, but you shall be put to shame;</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but you shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall wail for vexation of spirit.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> You shall leave your name for a curse to my chosen; and the Lord Yahweh will kill you; and he will call his servants by another name:</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> so that he who blesses himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he who swears in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from my eyes.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; and the former things shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> But be you glad and rejoice forever in that which I create; for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people; and there shall be heard in her no more the voice of weeping and the voice of crying.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> There shall be no more there an infant of days, nor an old man who has not filled his days; for the child shall die one hundred years old, and the sinner being one hundred years old shall be accursed.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> They shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree shall be the days of my people, and my chosen shall long enjoy the work of their hands.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> They shall not labor in vain, nor bring forth for calamity; for they are the seed of the blessed of Yahweh, and their offspring with them.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> It shall happen that, before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the ox; and dust shall be the serpent`s food. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, says Yahweh.</span></div>
