<div><h4>Isaiah 66</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Thus says Yahweh, heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool: what manner of house will you build to me? and what place shall be my rest?</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For all these things has my hand made, and [so] all these things came to be, says Yahweh: but to this man will I look, even to him who is poor and of a contrite spirit, and who trembles at my word.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> He who kills an ox is as he who kills a man; he who sacrifices a lamb, as he who breaks a dog`s neck; he who offers an offering, [as he who offers] pig`s blood; he who burns frankincense, as he who blesses an idol. Yes, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delights in their abominations:</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears on them; because when I called, none did answer; when I spoke, they did not hear: but they did that which was evil in my eyes, and chose that in which I didn`t delight.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Hear the word of Yahweh, you who tremble at his word: Your brothers who hate you, who cast you out for my name`s sake, have said, Let Yahweh be glorified, that we may see your joy; but it is those who shall be put to shame.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> A voice of tumult from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of Yahweh that renders recompense to his enemies.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she was delivered of a man-child.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Who has heard such a thing? who has seen such things? Shall a land be born in one day? shall a nation be brought forth at once? for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? says Yahweh: shall I who cause to bring forth shut [the womb]? says your God.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Rejoice you with Jerusalem, and be glad for her, all you who love her: rejoice for joy with her, all you who mourn over her;</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> that you may suck and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations; that you may milk out, and be delighted with the abundance of her glory.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> For thus says Yahweh, Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the nations like an overflowing stream: and you shall suck [of it]; you shall be borne on the side, and shall be dandled on the knees.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> As one whom his mother comforts, so will I comfort you; and you shall be comforted in Jerusalem.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> You shall see [it], and your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like the tender grass: and the hand of Yahweh shall be known toward his servants; and he will have indignation against his enemies.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> For, behold, Yahweh will come with fire, and his chariots shall be like the whirlwind; to render his anger with fierceness, and his rebuke with flames of fire.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> For by fire will Yahweh execute judgment, and by his sword, on all flesh; and the slain of Yahweh shall be many.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Those who sanctify themselves and purify themselves [to go] to the gardens, behind one in the midst, eating pig`s flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, they shall come to an end together, says Yahweh.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> For I [know] their works and their thoughts: [the time] comes, that I will gather all nations and languages; and they shall come, and shall see my glory.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> I will set a sign among them, and I will send such as escape of them to the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, who draw the bow, to Tubal and Javan, to the isles afar off, who have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory among the nations.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> They shall bring all your brothers out of all the nations for an offering to Yahweh, on horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and on mules, and on dromedaries, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, says Yahweh, as the children of Israel bring their offering in a clean vessel into the house of Yahweh.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Of them also will I take for priests [and] for Levites, says Yahweh.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, says Yahweh, so shall your seed and your name remain.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> It shall happen, that from one new moon to another, and from one Sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, says Yahweh.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> They shall go forth, and look on the dead bodies of the men who have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring to all flesh.</span></div>
