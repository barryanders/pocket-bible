<div><h4>Isaiah 22</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The burden of the valley of vision. What ails you now, that you are wholly gone up to the housetops?</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> You that are full of shouting, a tumultuous city, a joyous town; your slain are not slain with the sword, neither are they dead in battle.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> All your rulers fled away together, they were bound by the archers; all who were found of you were bound together; they fled afar off.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Therefore said I, Look away from me, I will weep bitterly; don`t labor to comfort me for the destruction of the daughter of my people.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For it is a day of confusion, and of treading down, and of perplexity, from the Lord, Yahweh of Hosts, in the valley of vision; a breaking down of the walls, and a crying to the mountains.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Elam bore the quiver, with chariots of men [and] horsemen; and Kir uncovered the shield.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> It happened that your choicest valleys were full of chariots, and the horsemen set themselves in array at the gate.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> He took away the covering of Judah; and you did look in that day to the armor in the house of the forest.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> You saw the breaches of the city of David, that they were many; and you gathered together the waters of the lower pool;</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> and you numbered the houses of Jerusalem, and you broke down the houses to fortify the wall;</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> you made also a reservoir between the two walls for the water of the old pool. But you didn`t look to him who had done this, neither had you respect to him who purposed it long ago.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> In that day did the Lord, Yahweh of Hosts, call to weeping, and to mourning, and to baldness, and to girding with sackcloth:</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> and behold, joy and gladness, killing oxen and killing sheep, eating flesh and drinking wine: let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we shall die.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Yahweh of Hosts revealed himself in my ears, Surely this iniquity shall not be forgiven you until you die, says the Lord, Yahweh of Hosts.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Thus says the Lord, Yahweh of Hosts, Go, get you to this treasurer, even to Shebna, who is over the house, [and say],</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> "What do you here? and whom has you here, that you have hewed you out here a tomb? Cutting him out a tomb on high, chiseling a habitation for himself in the rock!"</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Behold, Yahweh, like a [strong] man, will hurl you away violently; yes, he will wrap you up closely.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> He will surely wind you round and round, [and toss you] like a ball into a large country; there shall you die, and there shall be the chariots of your glory, you shame of your lord`s house.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> I will thrust you from your office; and from your station shall you be pulled down.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> It shall happen in that day, that I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah:</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> and I will cloth him with your robe, and strengthen him with your belt, and I will commit your government into his hand; and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to the house of Judah.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> The key of the house of David will I lay on his shoulder; and he shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none shall open.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> I will fasten him as a nail in a sure place; and he shall be for a throne of glory to his father`s house.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> They shall hang on him all the glory of his father`s house, the offspring and the issue, every small vessel, from the cups even to all the pitchers.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> In that day, says Yahweh of hosts, shall the nail that was fastened in a sure place give way; and it shall be hewn down, and fall; and the burden that was on it shall be cut off; for Yahweh has spoken it.</span></div>
