<div><h4>1 Chronicles 21</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Satan stood up against Israel, and moved David to number Israel.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> David said to Joab and to the princes of the people, Go, number Israel from Beersheba even to Dan; and bring me word, that I may know the sum of them.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Joab said, Yahweh make his people a hundred times as many as they are: but, my lord the king, aren`t they all my lord`s servants? why does my lord require this thing? why will he be a cause of guilt to Israel?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Nevertheless the king`s word prevailed against Joab. Why Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people to David. All those of Israel were one million one hundred thousand men who drew sword: and in Judah were four hundred seventy thousand men who drew sword.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> But he didn`t count Levi and Benjamin among them; for the king`s word was abominable to Joab.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> God was displeased with this thing; therefore he struck Israel.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> David said to God, I have sinned greatly, in that I have done this thing: but now, put away, I beg you, the iniquity of your servant; for I have done very foolishly.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Yahweh spoke to Gad, David`s seer, saying,</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Go and speak to David, saying, Thus says Yahweh, I offer you three things: choose you one of them, that I may do it to you.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> So Gad came to David, and said to him, Thus says Yahweh, Take which you will:</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> either three years of famine; or three months to be consumed before your foes, while the sword of your enemies overtakes you; or else three days the sword of Yahweh, even pestilence in the land, and the angel of Yahweh destroying throughout all the borders of Israel. Now therefore consider what answer I shall return to him who sent me.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> David said to Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall, I pray, into the hand of Yahweh; for very great are his mercies: and let me not fall into the hand of man.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> So Yahweh sent a pestilence on Israel; and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was about to destroy, Yahweh saw, and he repented him of the evil, and said to the destroying angel, It is enough; now stay your hand. The angel of Yahweh was standing by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of Yahweh standing between earth and the sky, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell on their faces.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> David said to God, Isn`t it I who commanded the people to be numbered? It is even I who have sinned and done very wickedly; but these sheep, what have they done? Please let your hand, O Yahweh my God, be against me, and against my father`s house; but not against your people, that they should be plagued.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Then the angel of Yahweh commanded Gad to tell David, that David should go up, and raise an altar to Yahweh in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spoke in the name of Yahweh.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons who were with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> As David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshing floor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Then David said to Ornan, Give me the place of this threshing floor, that I may build thereon an altar to Yahweh: for the full price shall you give it me, that the plague may be stayed from the people.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Ornan said to David, Take it to you, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes: behold, I give [you] the oxen for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meal-offering; I give it all.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> King David said to Ornan, No; but I will most assuredly buy it for the full price: for I will not take that which is your for Yahweh, nor offer a burnt-offering without cost.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> David built there an altar to Yahweh, and offered burnt offerings and peace-offerings, and called on Yahweh; and he answered him from the sky by fire on the altar of burnt offering.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Yahweh commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into the sheath of it.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> At that time, when David saw that Yahweh had answered him in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> For the tent of Yahweh, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt offering, were at that time in the high place at Gibeon.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> But David couldn`t go before it to inquire of God; for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of Yahweh.</span></div>
