<div><h4>Mark 1</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> As it is written in the prophets, "Behold, I send my messenger before your face, Who will prepare your way before you.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> The voice of one crying in the wilderness, `Make ready the way of the Lord, Make his paths straight.`"</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> John came baptizing in the wilderness and preaching the baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> There went out to him all the country of Judea, and all those of Jerusalem. They were baptized by him in the Jordan river, confessing their sins.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> John was clothed with camel`s hair and a leather belt around his loins. He ate locusts and wild honey.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> He preached, saying, "After me comes he who is mightier than I, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and loosen.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> I baptized you in water, but he will baptize you in the Holy Spirit."</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> It happened in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Immediately coming up from the water, he saw the heavens parting, and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> A voice came out of the sky, "You are my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Immediately the Spirit drove him out into the wilderness.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> He was there in the wilderness forty days tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals. The angels ministered to him.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Now after John was taken into custody, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> and saying, "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand! Repent, and believe in the gospel."</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Passing along by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew, the brother of Simon, casting a net in the sea, for they were fishermen.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Jesus said to them, "Come after me, and I will make you into fishers for men."</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Immediately they left their nets, and followed him.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Going on a little further from there, he saw James, the son of Zebedee, and John, his brother, who also were in the boat mending the nets.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Immediately he called them, and they left their father, Zebedee, in the boat with the hired servants, and went after him.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> They went into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> They were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit, and he cried out,</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> saying, "Ha! What do we have to do with you, Jesus, you Nazarene? Have you come to destroy us? I know you who you are: the Holy One of God."</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be quiet, and come out of him!"</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> The unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> They were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, "What is this? A new teaching? For with authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him."</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> The report of him went out immediately everywhere into all the region of Galilee and its surrounding area.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Immediately, when they had come out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Now Simon`s wife`s mother lay sick with a fever, and immediately they told him about her.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> He came and took her by the hand, and raised her up. The fever left her, and she served them.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> At evening, when the sun had set, they brought to him all who were sick, and those who were possessed with demons.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> All the city was gathered together at the door.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> He healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons. He didn`t allow the demons to speak, because they knew him.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> Early in the night, he rose up and went out, and departed into a desert place, and there prayed.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> Simon and those who were with him followed after him;</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> and they found him, and told him, "All are seeking you."</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> He said to them, "Let`s go elsewhere into the next towns, that I may preach there also, for to this end I came forth."</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> He went into their synagogues throughout all Galilee, preaching and casting out demons.</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> There came to him a leper, begging him, kneeling down to him, and saying to him, "If you want to, you can make me clean."</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> Being moved with compassion, he stretched forth his hand, and touched him, and said to him, "I want to. Be made clean."</span><span class="42"> <sup>42</sup> When he had said this, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was made clean.</span><span class="43"> <sup>43</sup> He strictly charged him, and immediately sent him out,</span><span class="44"> <sup>44</sup> and said to him, "See you say nothing to anybody, but go show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing the things which Moses commanded, for a testimony to them."</span><span class="45"> <sup>45</sup> But he went out, and began to proclaim it much, and to spread about the matter, so that Jesus could no more openly enter into a city, but was outside in desert places: and they came to him from everywhere.</span></div>
