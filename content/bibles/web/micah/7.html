<div><h4>Micah 7</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer       fruits, as the grape gleanings of the vintage: there is no       cluster to eat; my soul desires the first-ripe fig.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> The       godly man is perished out of the earth, and there is none upright       among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt every man       his brother with a net.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Their hands are on that which is       evil to do it diligently; the prince asks, and the judge [is       ready] for a reward; and the great man, he utters the evil desire       of his soul: thus they weave it together.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> The best of them       is as a brier; the most upright is [worse] than a thorn hedge:       the day of your watchmen, even your visitation, is come; now       shall be their perplexity.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Don`t you trust in a neighbor;       don`t you put confidence in a friend; keep the doors of your       mouth from her who lies in your bosom.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For the son       dishonors the father, the daughter rises up against her mother,       the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; a man`s enemies       are the men of his own house.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> But as for me, I will look to       Yahweh; I will wait for the God of my salvation: my God will hear       me.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Don`t rejoice against me, my enemy: when I fall, I       shall arise; when I sit in darkness, Yahweh will be a light to       me.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> I will bear the indignation of Yahweh, because I have       sinned against him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgment       for me: he will bring me forth to the light, [and] I shall see       his righteousness.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Then my enemy shall see it, and shame       shall cover her who said to me, Where is Yahweh your God? My eyes       shall see [my desire] on her; now shall she be trodden down as       the mire of the streets.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> A day for building your walls! in       that day shall the decree be far removed.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> In that day       shall they come to you from Assyria and the cities of Egypt, and       from Egypt even to the River, and from sea to sea, and [from]       mountain to mountain.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Yet shall the land be desolate       because of those who dwell therein, for the fruit of their       doings.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Feed your people with your rod, the flock of your       heritage, which dwell solitarily, in the forest in the midst of       Carmel: let them feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of       old.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> As in the days of your coming forth out of the land       of Egypt will I show to them marvelous things.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> The nations       shall see and be ashamed of all their might; they shall lay their       hand on their mouth; their ears shall be deaf.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> They shall       lick the dust like a serpent; like crawling things of the earth       they shall come trembling out of their close places; they shall       come with fear to Yahweh our God, and shall be afraid because of       you.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Who is a God like you, that pardons iniquity, and       passes over the disobedience of the remnant of his heritage? he       doesn`t retain his anger forever, because he delights in       lovingkindness.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> He will again have compassion on us; he       will tread our iniquities under foot; and you will cast all their       sins into the depths of the sea.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> You will perform the       truth to Jacob, [and] the lovingkindness to Abraham, which you       have sworn to our fathers from the days of old.</span></div>
