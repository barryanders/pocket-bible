<div><h4>Micah 2</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Woe to those who devise iniquity and work evil on their beds!       when the morning is light, they practice it, because it is in the       power of their hand.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> They covet fields, and seize them; and       houses, and take them away: and they oppress a man and his house,       even a man and his heritage.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Therefore thus says Yahweh:       Behold, against this family do I devise an evil, from which you       shall not remove your necks, neither shall you walk haughtily;       for it is an evil time.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> In that day shall they take up a       parable against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation, [and]       say, We are utterly ruined: he changes the portion of my people:       how does he remove [it] from me! to the rebellious he divides our       fields.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Therefore you shall have none who shall cast the       line by lot in the assembly of Yahweh.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Don`t you prophesy,       [thus] they prophesy. They shall not prophesy to these:       reproaches shall not depart.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Shall it be said, O house of       Jacob, Is the Spirit of Yahweh straitened? are these his doings?       Do not my words do good to him who walks blamelessly?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> But       of late my people is risen up as an enemy: you strip the robe       from off the garment from those who pass by securely [as men]       returned from war.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> The women of my people you cast out from       their pleasant houses; from their young children you take away my       glory forever.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Arise you, and depart; for this is not your       resting-place; because of uncleanness that destroys, even with a       grievous destruction.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> If a man walking in a spirit of       falsehood do lie, [saying], I will prophesy to you of wine and of       strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> I will surely assemble, Jacob, all of you; I will surely gather       the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of       Bozrah, as a flock in the midst of their pasture; they shall make       great noise by reason of [the multitude of] men.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> The       breaker is gone up before them: they have broken forth and passed       on to the gate, and are gone out thereat; and their king is       passed on before them, and Yahweh at the head of them.</span></div>
